This book sucks: This book just states the same stuff over and over about the fear of failure and doesnt help you one bit if you are suffering from this. I beg you not to read this book unless you have time to waste because its not worth your time at all.
"Tobor the Great - DVD review: Purchased through Amazon.com. This was a favorite robot movie from the early 1950s. I remember watching this movie on WGN's ""Family Classics"" with Frazier Thomas back in the 1960s. A little corn, but fun just the same. Very capable cast and the robot is fun to watch (you may have to smile a little, you know . . . come on!) Picture and sound quality are first rate. Hope you will consider adding to your collection. You'll be glad you did."
Product is not functional: I saw mixed reviews and thought for the price I would take a chance.That was a mistake. I received the item quickly (2 days) however once I opened the product Both Holsters were all but sewn shut. There is no way to place a weapon in either side. Both the top and the bottom of each holster has an opening about 1 inch only. It would appear this manufacture has no quality control at all. The item is now being returned for a refund as a replacement was not an option for this particular item.Please do not waste your time even at this price the product is not worth it as it just does not serve the intended purpose.
"I'm in double love with this rig!: I bought this with a couple other shoulder holster rigs from Amazon. I already have tactical vests with cross draw rigs on them and two drop holsters by UTG also from Amazon. I love this rig the best. I'm going to modify it with a couple extra magazine holders. It fits my Heckler and Koch USP .40 S&W I just bought last week extremely well. I plan on buying a second gun for the off-side. I can shoot left handed but rarely practice it. I'll have to work on the double cross-draw though. I will say none of the rigs I bought at Amazon were cheap quality. I liked each one of them, but this one is my favorite! Any rig that can easily hold my USP, my Taurus .357, my 1911 .45 is worth the money."
"BEWARE!!! NOT AN E.L.O. ALBUM!!!: For some reason, Amazon has mistakenly listed this as an ELO album. It is NOT. This is an album by ""ELO, Part II"" the band of ex-members and non-members, playing the songs of the original group. Jeff Lynne, the composer, arranger, singer and guitarist of all the music of ELO, does not appear. Buyer beware!!"
"Do you like SCOOBY DOO?: These cartoons are typical of late-1970s Hanna-Barbera TV output: cheap, poorly-animated, and horribly hampered by ridiculous network standards and practices. They stink."
Not a happy shopper.: The CDs was /is cracked to the point that it do not play . The disc were all very dirty and really didnt play at first.I am very disappointed and kinda feel that I wasted my money. I would let to exchange it or get replaced.
"No way to handle venomous snakes.: Teachers and parents should be advised that Steve Irwin is far more interested in Steve Irwin looking daring than in young peoples' welfare. If North American kids try handling any of our resident deadly snakes the way Irwin does, they'll end up very sick or possibly dead. Even non-venomous snakes should not be handled this way. Of course, the video does not >advocate< children handling snakes in this fashion, (So the distributors of this series could not be sued!) but that is not how a young audience works. There is a considerable risk that if something appears cool, it is worth ""having a try"" on one's own."
Error in description: This item's dimentions are incorrect in the description it is only 2 inches deep not 3 inches. Other than that it is a quality plano product.
Very useful: This item came quickly and was in good condition. It was easy to but together and it's very useful. I use it to separate craft stuff.
"Keep your readers turning pages: Whow, there's been a lot of different ratings on this book - but I don't doubt. This is a five. I don't agree with everything Bickham says, but the parts that stuck with me, improved my writing a LOT! If you need pace to your story, this tells you how to achieve it. If you wan't your readers to keep turning pages after midnight, this gives you great pointers. I edited my novel one last time (after I thought I was finished) and it made it so much better with Bickham's advice. This is definitely worth the time and money!"
"euphoria inducing: I can't remember the last time I have been so enchanted. In concert with her three back-up musicians, she plays jazz piano with such vitality, muscularity and confidence, and croons with such sensual leisurely-ness, the overall experience is orgasmic."
"Diana Krall is a Boring Singer!!!!: This CD will put you to sleep. Even her REMIXES are boring. I hate this CD!!!! She is not a DIVA. To be a DIVA you must have style, talent and some history. She must read the life of Carmen Miranda (Brazil), Marlena Dietrich (Germany), Edith Piaf (France), Betty Davis (USA)... and she will know what to be a DIVA is about. CRAP!!!!!!"
a good overview of early hawkwind: the sound quality ranges from good to very good but the tunes say it all . kind of like boc meets the floyd but totally original and brain numbing ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK YOULL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN !!!
"Don't bother: This book is poorly written, poorly argued, and poorly documented. It would serve the author well to consider the following statement: Assertion has no truth value. He asserts his points with poor backing."
"Ecellent reading, if author had provided reference material.: Although I found this book to be excellent reading, I was very disappointed that the author failed to publish his references and documentation for source of his information. It would improve the rating of the book if this information was available. Is this information available?"
A very good book: The story of Squirrel Nutkin who is a very disrespectful and rude and provocative squirrel who gets taught a very tough lesson. Learning is not alway painless. Learning is not always pleasurable or fun. This is a fact of life.
somewhat disappointing: I thought this book would have more of a spiritual focus and it was more nutritionally based. I was looking for a more clear tie between nutrition and God's Word.
"Joe Maphis, Merle Travis Country Music's Two guitar greats.: Joe and Merle were friends for years, often appearing on Town Hall Party in Compton Califonia. Joe was one of the fastest guitar pickers in the world, while Merle played his famous Travis Still finger picking. This is a must for anyone interested in guitar legends."
"A highly recommended version of the classic!: I just finished watching this, and I actually felt that I HAD to come and recommend it to someone thinking of watching it. I have read the book, and I felt that this adaptation was fairly faithful to the story. Unfortunately, I haven't seen any other film/T.V. adaptations, so I can't compare on that score. However, I loved the acting in this version--Ciaran Hinds gives an especially amazing performance, making you loathe and pity the character of Michael Henchard. By himself, he makes this movie worth the watching, but everyone else does a great job too. I watched the entire dvd in one sitting--I loved it. It won't make you leave happy, but that's Thomas Hardy for you."
"The Mayor of Casterbridge with Ciaran Hinds: I saw this on PBS..(this particular one with Ciaran Hinds, who I love as an actor) many years ago, and finally saw it on Amazon and couldn't wait to buy it....!!! It is a wonderful story....at times heartbreaking....! Everyone should see this story.....you'll never forget it! A personal favorite! Still need to read the book, though!"
"misleading planning & time frames for a beginner: unfortunately, the magical transformation of the author into a competitive athlete is a unique event, not one that readers will replicate easily (or ever!), especially following the plans inside.the author ignores the base building necessary to race the events. athletes need to train their musculoskeletal structure to take the abuse of workouts as much as they need to get their hearts up to speed. this is best done slowly and incrementally. i think if you have been a regular athlete for at least a year before using the plan in this book, you may be fine.if you are beginning in any of the three sports, i'd advise another book to show the real process of developing the appropriate base needed to compete without injury. Look up the titles by Joe Friel for more complete information on how to structure a training plan."
SUPERB ACTION FILM: Great to see this awesome action film out at last. Wonderful cast and rousing entertainment.....superb.To Maxwell Mattford my comments on this film being in pan & scan (I know it's not) was that the intial info supplied prior to release was that it was to be a full screen release now that it is released we know different...maybe you should check YOUR info before you mouth off
"The Wild Geese: For those who are fans of ""War/Mercenary Theme"" tales, The Wild Geese is a classic. Outstanding Stars, outstanding actions, outstanding music. It is an action packed story of men, a nations' adversities from within, and the steps taken to relieve the strife. In the guise of securing freedom for a deposed and incarcerated leader and re-establishing a democracratic free state, mercenaries are hired and sent on a mission into catastrophe. The mercenaries and freed leader are used as pawns in mineral rights schemes between a greedy English Lord and the ruling despot. The mercenary unit and the now freed leader are left stranded when their plane to safety passes them by. Now pursued, the relationships of men, ideals, and their need to survive, demonstrate the power and will that mens' hearts can muster when the real needs are the life of this leader and the freedom of his people. Retribution by the surviving mercenaries is methodical and thorough. Not a movie for to be taken lightly."
"Beers Steers & Queers ~ Revolting Cocks: Revolting Cocks is one of Alain Jourgensens many side projects and its amazing, weird, disturbing and stupendous at the same time. The lyrics are filled with rage, venom and anger. Alain Jourgensen is as crazy as ever and he has written something quite special. Tracks such as beer, steers and quuers, stainless steel providers and (Lets get) Physical are all really well done. The cover for this album is very nice and presents some of the members on what looks like an old roman coin and the book-let is sparse yet the logotype is well done and not as odd or strange as other Jourgensen albums."
"A LOT OF STEPS BACKWARDS: When I thought Mercyful Fate had stopped writing stupid lyrics about Satan, changing into more acceptable ""horror movie"" lyrcs, they go bakc to Satanism. I have no prejudice about that, but it is just ridiculous nowadays. Come on, King Diamond, and Hank Shermann: you can do better than that."
"Another Classic: A longtime fan of Mercyful Fate and King Diamond, I still spend each week wishing for the next album, usually within weeks of a new release. Make no mistake, that is not meant as a negative comment towards Fate or Diamond, I just can't get enough! These guys are pros at producing music designed for reducing speakers to piles of rubble.It has been said that you can't judge a book by it's cover, but this album cover is a direct insight into the hellish content. Last Rites was an immediate favorite, The Grave with it's crunching guitars and Diamonds resilient vocals, another great, and Buried Alive, an addictive melodic metal mix. Needless to say, this is definitely a Mercyful Fate classic."
"Amazing Book - I felt like I was there: I read this book in 4 days, it was amazing and I could not tear my eyes from the pages. I have always been interested in the Civil War Era, but have not really read anything about the civil war probably since High School. I have to say that this was an excellent book that has reignited my interest. This book covers the last year or so, and only the history of the Army of the Potamac, and does so in a way that makes you feel like you are there with the soldiers, cussing the officers along with them.Some of the parts of the book are hilarious, like the description of the battle of Spotsylvania Court House, I was rolling in tears. Some are incredibly frustrating, like Cold Harbor. Some are just plain sad, like the description of the ""crater"" assault at Petersburg.All in all, I am happy I bought and read this book, it was excellent, and it was one of those books that I wish would have gone on another 300 pages."
"One so-so song, so one star..: This record is by far Neil Young and crazy Horses' worst. No need to own this at all, not even for completeists. ""inca Queen"" is the only half-decent song here, and it's overproduced. Avoid this CD!"
"Just what I needed: Only one seller had one left. I got it,and now the garage computer is up and running again.Works like champ for browsing online.Not in prodcution anymore, but I still buy Nvidiachipsets on all my video cards."
"No tweezers or toothpick: This version of the Classic is missing the tweezers and toothpick. It would make a stylish ""statement gift"", or a nice addition to a collection, but if you just want a useful little knife you'd get more functionality with a regular Classic for a lot less money, and less weight too. This style is noticeably heavier than a regular Classic with plastic sides."
"Worthy wine-related adventures: What could be more fun than finding and tasting unlikely wines in unlikely places? Not much, and this book is mostly a joy to read. It made me want to visit some of the same far-flung places and help cheer on the valiant winemakers doing such remarkable things. One exasperating thing about this book, though: the type is a deadly combination of tiny and pale, which makes it very tough on the eyes. Perhaps there wasn't enough ink on the press when my copy was printed, but it seems more like an intentional choice by a designer with the eyes of a 25-year-old rather than those of someone over 50. Too bad, because the words and stories deserve more prominence."
"his third worst: Dissapointing. Young can play just about any genre well and country is no exception. The reason is: you believe him. He's not faking it. On Old Ways, he sounds like he's faking it. He sings these cover songs like he's at a kareoke. Worst of all, he sings with a twang that is equal parts irritating and laughable. Maybe that was his point--showing the world he didn't care. This album does kind of come across as an inside joke. Buy this album only if you're a Young completist. Otherwise, stay away. Trust me."
"Neil Young's Best Album! Five Stars is not enough!: This album is a must own for Neil Young Fans Who like country music. We also have copies of Unplugged and Harvest Moon, but nothing by Neil Young is as good as this. If you live way out in the country and have a sound system, buy this CD and play it in your car. Will make you think of the countryside as you listen to it. Listen to California sunset or The Wayward Wind and you'll see what I mean."
"Sublime.: If you've got a son, buy it just for the track ""My Boy"". Fix yourself a stiff whiskey, close the drapes, settle in your favorite easy chair, and enjoy."
"Poor quality, sent it back: This shoe rack is shoddy quality. The screws used to ""secure"" it together do not ever fully tighten. The rack feels wobbly and like it will fall apart if you were to fully load it with the number of shoes it claims to be able to hold. I returned it immediately--didn't trust it to hold shoes overnight."
"There's a Reason it's So Cheap: The instrumental portion of the CD is very good. Just what you would expect from a ""Lounge Music"" genre. But where did they find those female singers? Yikes, makes the hair on the back of my head stand on end. Would be a great CD without the vocals."
"A disappointed Christie fan: I thought I would love this, but like an earlier reviewer said, the supernatural mysteries were a bit disappointing. When I read a Christie mystery, I want to find out who did it in the end. When she writes the supernatural ones, the ending is left a bit unexplained, which I found aggravating. Also, some stories have a sad ending, which seems unusual compared with her other works."
"Great Quality, Comfy, Durable, Warm, and Versatile: My girlfriend bought me these slippers about 5 years ago and I've been wearing them ever since. Winter is when they get used mostly because they are so warm. I wear them constantly around the house and even out to run errands. The slippers have stood up to the abuse of the outdoors.They've completely held up and almost look brand new. The only thing is on the bottom the suede is wearing away a little, but after 5 years, I'd say that's to be expected.I love them so much I bought my father a pair."
"Happy with the style but the fit could be better: I looked at a lot of slippers before picking this one. None fulfilled all of what I was looking for. In the end I'm happy but I wish the sole extended fully to the outer edge of the foot to be more stable. Also if the back of the slipper extended higher up toward the ankle, it would prevent my heal from lifting out when walking quickly."
"These run very small!: I bought these for my husband and although they looked nice and cozy they run very very small. I ordered him an 11, which he usually wears in a slipper, to allow room for heavy socks for winter, and they were so tight across the instep that he couldn't stand to have them on. I sent them back. These are too expensive to not fit right."
"UGG Australia (china) Men's Ascot Slippers: You can't even get sheepskin from Australia, what kind of world are we living in. I am trying so hard to spend lots of money online....at Amazon. But everything is from china, and the reviews show quality is bad and prices full retail."
"Painfully SLOW: I was expecting a very interesting read from this book, but just could not finish it. The characters were dull and the storyline was monotonous and never seemed to go anywhere. Elizabeth Barrett Browning was just plain depressing. I kept hoping something exciting would happen, so I kept on reading, but stopped before I reached the halfway mark. Just too tedious."
"The Lady's Maid: This book was our book club pick last month. I would say only half of us read it . It was so slow in starting , I almost did not finish it. However, I loved Elizabeth Barrett and Robt Browning when I was younger . So I gave it another try and finished it. I felt it was too drawn out and very slow to start. This is the reason why I only gave it 2 stars."
Contended with this Book!: I read this Puritan classic as a devotional in the morning. A needed reminder for me to be content in all things.
strong cargo rack: This rack is strong and can carry a lot of weight. I use it all the time for work and play. The only complaint I have is that once put together it looks like it dips down on one side.
Works but mine broke after a few months of occasional use.: Mostly plastic. Can be very hard to zero. Lettering too small to read unless you lift it up near your face. Mine broke after a few months of occasional use. If you plan to use more than 10-15 times then you should get something better.
"Awaken to Superconsciousness: This book gives that unusual balance of deep inspiration andsupportive application. There's a clear orientation here towardsgiving the deepest understanding of what meditation andsuperconsciousness are really all about, but also you come away having a solid handle on how to actually meditate and make it an integrated part of day-to-day life. You get the refreshing feeling from this book that spirituality isn't just a nice idea but a very real way to be more alive! This is definitely a ""keeper""!P.S.,there's also a great companion tape available that has guided meditations."
"Lights, Camera, Sex! by Christy Canyon: A very intertesting story into the darker side of life that a few people will every travel in their life time. Christy Canyon comes out the other side I think much better off in life."
"Ted's explanation of the band.: The second half of this '2-LPs on one CD' disc is a very listenable collection of English ""folk"" tunes (Greenseleeves, Lincolnshire Poacher, London Bridge, etc). The first half (all 24 cuts of it)is a wonderfully entertaining, crisp and lucid explanation of how the instruments in a modern dance band line up, blend, and generally produce fine music. It includes an explanation of how Glenn Miller first achieved his unique sound. As well as educational, it is highly listenable."
Wrong book sent.: I order this book it was said to be a Chilton's it was Hayes. And to top it off it was for a truck
"great case: I bought this case for my relatively small digital camera. Works great...lightweight, easy to carry with the strap, and many little pockets to store things (extra batteries, etc.). It is very durable also. I would buy again"
"Right up there with ""The Best of Uriah Heep"": Boy this is a bad album. It's really not even worth listening to after you've heard it once. There are a couple of good melodies in a couple of the songs, but nothing on here is completely a good song. My guess is that Mr. Young really wanted this album NOT to sell, so Geffen wouldn't make a lot of money off of it."
"Neil Young's worst album of all time!!!!!!!!!: I had the unfortunate experience of hearing this album again last week which reminded me why I traded in this piece of garbage years ago in college. This is hands down ""THE WORST NEIL ALBUM EVER""!Electric drum kit? Please. At least it fits the trend of the '80s....his worst album would be released during the worst music decade. Do yourself a favor and save your ears...don't buy or even listen to this album unless you need a laxative."
"Doesn't live up to the hype: This is not a bad series, but I think perhaps I was going into it expecting too much. The reviews here have been so strong and so overwhelmingly positive that I was expecting a masterpiece. I didn't get it. The only two End Times novels I've ever read before this was Left Behind and We All Fall Down. This is certainly better than Left Behind (To be fair, I've only read the first one)but doesn't come anywhere near the quality of We all Fall Down. I baught all three books at one time and wished that I hadn't. This is a facinating premise, but that's all. There's no real exploration of Christian life and I certainly don't feel like I have a better understanding of my faith. This certainly didn't illuminate me or help me in that area. The characters are also fairly unengaging. Again, this is quite a bit better than Left Behind, but that's not really saying much. Perhaps if you read it with lowered expectations you will enjoy it more than I did."
"Perfect for readers of LEFT BEHIND!!!: THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY is the perfect addition for readers of the LEFT BEHIND series. See the Tribulation from the other side with an Antichrist you'd be proud to take home to meet mom and dad. He's just sooooo good at being bad! But hang in there, the truth comes out in the end. I loved the TRILOGY so much I'm going to read it again while I wait for THE REMNANT to come out!!!"
"Wonderful everday flatware!: My husband and I chose this as our wedding pattern for everyday, and we love it! After 4 years, it still looks the same as the day we bought it-- no scratches or swirls like other brands.This is a nice pattern to hold, as well. It feels good in your hand and curves with your hand-- some of the other patterns we tried did not. It's a good weight, too-- a sturdy piece, but not overbearingly heavy like others.I have all the pieces of this pattern, and not only is a nice to look at, but it's affordable. I highly recommend it to everyone needing a good, elegant but simple everyday pattern."
"Excellent product: This is a very nice sturdy towel rack. I was looking for a shiny chrome piece for towels that would allow a towel to be completely unfolded to dry properly, and this is it! I was a little confused about the ""white box"" wording in the description, but when the product arrived, it is in a white shipping box, that's it. Looks like it will hold up well through many years of service. Very classy piece! Highly recommend it if you have nice polished chrome fixtures in your bath, as it accents them well."
"Product is not as described: My poor rating is based not on the actual product, but the fact the product I received is not the classical collection as described in Amazon's product details. Rather it's a collection of popular holiday favorites performed by the Montgomery Smith [saxophone] Quintet and published by Reflections. Songs include ""I'll Be Home for Christmas"", ""Christmas Time Is Here"", ""What Child Is This"", ""Let It Snow"", ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"", ""O Christmas Tree"", ""Happy Holidays"", ""The Christmas Song"", ""What Are You Doing New Years Eve"", ""Silver Bells"", ""Merry Christmas Baby"", ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus"", ""Winter Wonderland"", ""White Christmas"". This product is only available through third parties. Be sure to verify the product with seller before you order."
"Dissapointed: I saw some reviews about it, I read some info...But I am still dissapointed.When I tryed to open his legs, they broke. (they are not metal as shown on picture, they are made of some kind plactic)Two legs broke even without forceing it to open.Now I am using it as ordinar flashlight but still not as good as any other. Light flickers (2-3 times in 5 seconds) and has very short range.Next time I will buy Larget Stanley tripod. Hope theyr quality is better."
"Great Flashlight (at first): Although this flashlight is compact it is rugged, bright and very useful in tight spaces. The head has 2 positions to adjust the light beam. It also has a high quality switch making it difficult to turn on by accident in your pocket. Review update!After 3 months the switch quit working, it is now usless. so much for high quality :/"
Save Your Money For Something Worth it: I have been using it for over a month now ... just to make this simple :at first the material felt good enough and the light was good for a small closed areaBut now it doesn't light any more .. it's more like a flashing thingyi Thing the warranty would have been useful for me except that i don't live in the US Right nowbut to be fair it's real small and effective in some situations.
Good Instructional Video: This is actually a really good DVD. It teaches you how to do the moves in a fun way. Highly recommended.
"One of Hofstadter's best.: This is a really seminal work. Hofstadter's writing is the first thing that struck me. It is fluid, crisp, and devoid of the florid verbosity that so often fills scholarly treatments (let's face it, good historians are rarely good writers).The parallels between the bust-and-boom of Western commercial real estate in 1880s and the modern economic crisis are eerily similar. In addition, a lot of the rhetoric that emerged from the Progressive movement (railing against the securitization of finance, corporate greed, etc.) is resurfacing now, over 100 years later.It's really an essential work for anyone interested in the Populist and Progressive movements. I look forward to reading more Hofstadter."
"An excellent ""how-to"" for independent investors.: This is a great book for individuals who think they are ready to break away from reliance on the big brokerage houses. Mr. Siris gives detailed advice on how to effectively use the internet to gather the ""intelligence"" needed to make wise decisions. The book also contains a variety of tips for both the technical and value investor. Overall, I found this book to be very enlightening."
"horrible, stupid, annoying - avoid!: OMG - We love Scooby but it was painful to watch this bunch of crap.My three year old watched it and enjoyed it but I thought it was so bad I refused to let her watch it again. I got rid of it ASAP."
"Very cute movie, great for kids-that's who it's for-right?!?: I have to agree with many of the other reviews in that, I missed the rest of the gang and I am not a big fan of Scrappy Doo. That said however, this movie is extremely cute and entertaining. My 3 year old daughter loves it. It does get a bit repetitive with 'suttle' jokes, but other than that, it is a very good movie. Not like their typical Scooby flicks, and that is why it is neat to see something different. Better than Zombie Island-that is awful for children. They crossed a fine line in that one!"
"A WONDERFLY FUNNY BRIT COM IN BOOK FORM!: IT'S EASY TO SEE HOW THIS FUN READ MADE IT TO THE TOP OF THE NY TIMES BEST SELLER LIST!! THE BOOK WAS ALSO CHOSEN BY AARP MAGAZINE. THIS BOOK WOULD EVEN BE A GREAT GIFT FOR THE PERSON WHO DOES YOUR EYEBROWS! I LAUGHED ALOUD OFTEN! I ENJOYED THIS READ SO MUCH, THAT I'VE ALSO READ MANY OTHER OF MS. KINSELLA'S BOOKS AND SHARED THEM WITH FAMILY AND GIRLFRIENDS!"
Wife and Mother: This is the best book I've ever read dealing with relationships. I recommend it highly if you want to have a wonderful marriage!
"Same old BS: Nothing new here, spun as a shocking insight. They push possible EMP attack as an Iranian threat, well surprise hillbillies, EMP attack is part of any nations nuclear first strike. I want these crazies out just like everyone else, but another invasion in the middle east is not the answer. This film not only leaves out critical data, it spins the same old stuff we already know into a whirlpool trying to create a new threat. Dont be dumb enough to let this terrible piece of propaganda film making have an effect on you. Yes they need to go, and they will when the people of Iran are ready. Sean Hannity spins this as a wakeup call, he must have been asleep for the last 10 years, welcome to the same old take on the same old Iran. Funded by an Israeli foundation out of NY, this is clearly an appeal to the NeoCon mindset for first strike. If your looking for that kind of dribble, head on over to Project for a New American Century, at least over there it's free."
"The Log of a Cowboy: Not for everybody but full of info and down-to-earth experiences to help you get ""into"" the cowboy life."
"disappointed: Ordered this book thinking that the positive review on amazon was a good recommendation, wrong! The book is a photo copied version of an old text, and the copier evidently left out the last couple of pages, which I felt were very important to the book. Also, the price reflects a price that would indicate it is more valuable, but in fact to me was much over-rated and over priced. Don't buy this book!"
"One of the best of this genre: This book is a lot of fun to read, taking the reader back in time to a late-1800s cattle drive from Texas to Montana. The book is written well with spare prose, wit and exceptional details about a cowboy's often difficult and sometimes boring life on the trail. There's refreshingly little of the syrup found in so many western stories. It's written simply enough for pre-teens interested in the west, yet it will yield a lot of enjoyment for the seasoned reader."
Great resource book: This book helps you figure out your figure. I learned things I never knew about altering patterns and getting a good fit. I use this book as a resource and enjoy it. The instructions are fairly clear. I would recommend you have some sewing basics before using the book.
"Guillermo Herrera Arreola: Chayito. Felicidades por este maravilloso CD. que es una selección de las canciones que más se escuchan en México, y aunque este CD. ahún no esta en venta en nuestro país, yo lo compre en Chicago y estoy facinado con el. Espero pronto tener tu nueva producción de Discos Musart ( los 2 anteriores ya los tengo : el de tambora y el de la moneda se voltió).Un abrazo y que Dios te bendiga.Con AmorGuillermo Herrera"
"what a helpless and hopeless movie: VERY artificial emotions. you see poor Sandra crying and pretending to be sad, and it doesn't move you one little bit. Even Gena Rowland wasn't acting like she usually does. It's not worth watching it. keeps draaagggging on..."
"Cry every time: As a child of divorce I know how it feel to hate the one person that you should love the most! Thinking to one that broke the marriage is the hero while the one that is in pain is the villian. This movie brings me back every time. I wish so much that my mother has a much strength as Berdie did in this film. I can watch this movie over and over just to listen to the music it contains. The soundtrack is one in a million. You can play it through and through and enjoy every song on it! I would recommend this movie for any woman that has every had her heart broken, ever been a child of divorce, or ever wants inspiration to move on in life and accomplish great things when they seem most impossible!!!!"
"Touching Movie: HOPE FLOATS is an excellent movie about finding yourself and learning to move on and have hope to live again. Sandra Bullock plays Birdie, a woman who's husband was cheating on her with her best friend, exposed on a national talk show. Although the premise of the story is a bit cliche, it was a good way to open the movie. She moves back home with her daughter, and they live with her mother (played by Gena Rowlands excellently). Birdie gets over the devestation by realizing that her husband did not define her, and finds the courage to live again for her family. Harry Conick Jr. plays Justin, a past love of Birdie's, who also helps her out. The movie is deeply affirmed in the fact that hope will float again. A lot of people were disapointed with this movie but I really enjoy it, it has a strong sense of family and a very strong meaning behind the plot. Go see it!"
"Great Movie..and soundtrack!: I was impressed! I had avoided seeing this movie for years because I thought it looked like it was going to be a really bad, cheesy, cliche, chic flick. Then one night it was on tv and I was like, what the hell,I was bored so I figured why not?! Well, by the end of the movie I was in tears because I was so moved. I can't explain exactly what it is I liked about it. It was a simple movie...and yet so touching. It had alittle bit of romance, alittle bit of comedy, and it felt so real. I was also very impressed w/ the movie's soundtrack, so much so that I now intend to buy the cd! I would highly recommend this movie! Even my husband ended up watching it with me and enjoying it."
"A good movie: I rented this disc last night and it was a pretty good movie. The performances are the best part of the film, especially Gena Rowlands and Mae Whitman. Sandra Bullock gives her most nuanced performance to date."
Could have been better story.: A thin plot that dragged on without any redemption in the end. Bought it for my wife as a stocking stuffer on christmas. Would have been easy to find a much better movie. If you were entertained by this then you obviously are easily entertained. Not one of Sandra Bullocks better movies. The effort was a waste of her talents.
"mary russell tapes: My family absolutely loves these books and we think Jenny Stirlin does a great job as a reader. (Her American accents aren't the greatest, but she reads the book with familiarity.) I would highly recommend them as great books to listen to on a road trip."
"Well now Really!: I guess that we should hand one star over to the author for creativity, but any true Doyle fan knows that Sherlock Holmes would never marry anyone. This novel is a disgrace to literature,and I am sure the great creator of Holmes is rolling over in his grave at the thought of this almost blasphemous pastiche. Not a good read. Go find the originals.... with this you are just wasting your time."
"Great Expectations: I must agree with a reader from Worcester, MA. The Beekeepers Apprentice continues to be my favorite book of all time, but starting with ""A Monstrous Regiment of Woman"" and going through ""The Moor"" Ms. King has completely bottomed out. I have not yet read ""O Jerusalem"", i will try it, but if it continues in the pattern of the previous three I plan on not finishing it. ""The Moor"" had great possibilities, but the solution is given away by the end of chapter 13. I was extremely disappointed by the amount of time she used describing the moor. All around it was a disappointing read."
"Don't Waste Your Time: After a few rather good works in this series, The Moor is a big let down. It is one of the most boring Sherlock Holmes pastiches I have ever read.Don't waste your time on this one."
"Good CD for those that liked Eighties Films: At first I only thought this CD was okay since I liked most of the original songs better, but it grows on you. Phantom Planet's cover of Somebody's Baby is the best track but the others are also cool. I recommend this if you love the eighties teen movies cos this brings back all the memories. One of my fave compilation CDs in my collection now."
"ZonePlayer 80: Great add-on device to my music system, bringing internet music and digital music from my computer to my theater system. It seems expensive for for merely converting wifi radio frequency to RCA inputs to the home theater system. Especially when I realized I needed to buy another bridge device to connect this unit to the home network. But it is simple to install and use. It is unobtrusive and clean."
"An A-typical performance for a superb playwright: although we are fans of Shakespeare and his other works, we have found this play to be below usual Shakespeare standards. Billy Shakes did a poor job of combining three unoriginal story lines the result being something may have served as shallow entertainment for Elizabethian audience of peasants, but compared to other works it fails in containing any moral or intellectual value. Try MacBeth or even Romeo and Juliet.... We seriously believe, even though it has been emphasized that Billy has mocked the place of women in society though they seem triumphant. We resent the fact the switching of the roles, which looks as if Billy were jesting them. As stated before, other plays of Billy Shakes were better and we recommend those."
"Be careful there is a newer model v3 with better cpu!: Be careful! Netgear is not telling people that there are 3 versions of the FVS318 (v1, v2 and v3)! Version 3 has a better CPU and uses a different firmware (v3.0). I feel cheated! Because Netgear sells all the older FVS318 as though they are all the same! Not the newest v3 model! What a low life company somebody should sue them. If the Netgear FVS318 has a new cpu then give it a new model number! But they don't, so most of us are buying earlier out-of-date models! Those of us who thought we were buying the latest model were being scammed and defrauded! Shame on Netgear!"
