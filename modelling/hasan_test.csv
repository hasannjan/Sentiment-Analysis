This book sucks: This book just states the same stuff over and over about the fear of failure and doesnt help you one bit if you are suffering from this. I beg you not to read this book unless you have time to waste because its not worth your time at all.
"Tobor the Great - DVD review: Purchased through Amazon.com. This was a favorite robot movie from the early 1950s. I remember watching this movie on WGN's ""Family Classics"" with Frazier Thomas back in the 1960s. A little corn, but fun just the same. Very capable cast and the robot is fun to watch (you may have to smile a little, you know . . . come on!) Picture and sound quality are first rate. Hope you will consider adding to your collection. You'll be glad you did."
Product is not functional: I saw mixed reviews and thought for the price I would take a chance.That was a mistake. I received the item quickly (2 days) however once I opened the product Both Holsters were all but sewn shut. There is no way to place a weapon in either side. Both the top and the bottom of each holster has an opening about 1 inch only. It would appear this manufacture has no quality control at all. The item is now being returned for a refund as a replacement was not an option for this particular item.Please do not waste your time even at this price the product is not worth it as it just does not serve the intended purpose.
"I'm in double love with this rig!: I bought this with a couple other shoulder holster rigs from Amazon. I already have tactical vests with cross draw rigs on them and two drop holsters by UTG also from Amazon. I love this rig the best. I'm going to modify it with a couple extra magazine holders. It fits my Heckler and Koch USP .40 S&W I just bought last week extremely well. I plan on buying a second gun for the off-side. I can shoot left handed but rarely practice it. I'll have to work on the double cross-draw though. I will say none of the rigs I bought at Amazon were cheap quality. I liked each one of them, but this one is my favorite! Any rig that can easily hold my USP, my Taurus .357, my 1911 .45 is worth the money."
"BEWARE!!! NOT AN E.L.O. ALBUM!!!: For some reason, Amazon has mistakenly listed this as an ELO album. It is NOT. This is an album by ""ELO, Part II"" the band of ex-members and non-members, playing the songs of the original group. Jeff Lynne, the composer, arranger, singer and guitarist of all the music of ELO, does not appear. Buyer beware!!"
"Do you like SCOOBY DOO?: These cartoons are typical of late-1970s Hanna-Barbera TV output: cheap, poorly-animated, and horribly hampered by ridiculous network standards and practices. They stink."
Not a happy shopper.: The CDs was /is cracked to the point that it do not play . The disc were all very dirty and really didnt play at first.I am very disappointed and kinda feel that I wasted my money. I would let to exchange it or get replaced.
"No way to handle venomous snakes.: Teachers and parents should be advised that Steve Irwin is far more interested in Steve Irwin looking daring than in young peoples' welfare. If North American kids try handling any of our resident deadly snakes the way Irwin does, they'll end up very sick or possibly dead. Even non-venomous snakes should not be handled this way. Of course, the video does not >advocate< children handling snakes in this fashion, (So the distributors of this series could not be sued!) but that is not how a young audience works. There is a considerable risk that if something appears cool, it is worth ""having a try"" on one's own."
Error in description: This item's dimentions are incorrect in the description it is only 2 inches deep not 3 inches. Other than that it is a quality plano product.
Very useful: This item came quickly and was in good condition. It was easy to but together and it's very useful. I use it to separate craft stuff.
"Keep your readers turning pages: Whow, there's been a lot of different ratings on this book - but I don't doubt. This is a five. I don't agree with everything Bickham says, but the parts that stuck with me, improved my writing a LOT! If you need pace to your story, this tells you how to achieve it. If you wan't your readers to keep turning pages after midnight, this gives you great pointers. I edited my novel one last time (after I thought I was finished) and it made it so much better with Bickham's advice. This is definitely worth the time and money!"
"euphoria inducing: I can't remember the last time I have been so enchanted. In concert with her three back-up musicians, she plays jazz piano with such vitality, muscularity and confidence, and croons with such sensual leisurely-ness, the overall experience is orgasmic."
"Diana Krall is a Boring Singer!!!!: This CD will put you to sleep. Even her REMIXES are boring. I hate this CD!!!! She is not a DIVA. To be a DIVA you must have style, talent and some history. She must read the life of Carmen Miranda (Brazil), Marlena Dietrich (Germany), Edith Piaf (France), Betty Davis (USA)... and she will know what to be a DIVA is about. CRAP!!!!!!"
a good overview of early hawkwind: the sound quality ranges from good to very good but the tunes say it all . kind of like boc meets the floyd but totally original and brain numbing ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK YOULL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN !!!
"Don't bother: This book is poorly written, poorly argued, and poorly documented. It would serve the author well to consider the following statement: Assertion has no truth value. He asserts his points with poor backing."
"Ecellent reading, if author had provided reference material.: Although I found this book to be excellent reading, I was very disappointed that the author failed to publish his references and documentation for source of his information. It would improve the rating of the book if this information was available. Is this information available?"
A very good book: The story of Squirrel Nutkin who is a very disrespectful and rude and provocative squirrel who gets taught a very tough lesson. Learning is not alway painless. Learning is not always pleasurable or fun. This is a fact of life.
somewhat disappointing: I thought this book would have more of a spiritual focus and it was more nutritionally based. I was looking for a more clear tie between nutrition and God's Word.
"Joe Maphis, Merle Travis Country Music's Two guitar greats.: Joe and Merle were friends for years, often appearing on Town Hall Party in Compton Califonia. Joe was one of the fastest guitar pickers in the world, while Merle played his famous Travis Still finger picking. This is a must for anyone interested in guitar legends."
"A highly recommended version of the classic!: I just finished watching this, and I actually felt that I HAD to come and recommend it to someone thinking of watching it. I have read the book, and I felt that this adaptation was fairly faithful to the story. Unfortunately, I haven't seen any other film/T.V. adaptations, so I can't compare on that score. However, I loved the acting in this version--Ciaran Hinds gives an especially amazing performance, making you loathe and pity the character of Michael Henchard. By himself, he makes this movie worth the watching, but everyone else does a great job too. I watched the entire dvd in one sitting--I loved it. It won't make you leave happy, but that's Thomas Hardy for you."
"The Mayor of Casterbridge with Ciaran Hinds: I saw this on PBS..(this particular one with Ciaran Hinds, who I love as an actor) many years ago, and finally saw it on Amazon and couldn't wait to buy it....!!! It is a wonderful story....at times heartbreaking....! Everyone should see this story.....you'll never forget it! A personal favorite! Still need to read the book, though!"
"misleading planning & time frames for a beginner: unfortunately, the magical transformation of the author into a competitive athlete is a unique event, not one that readers will replicate easily (or ever!), especially following the plans inside.the author ignores the base building necessary to race the events. athletes need to train their musculoskeletal structure to take the abuse of workouts as much as they need to get their hearts up to speed. this is best done slowly and incrementally. i think if you have been a regular athlete for at least a year before using the plan in this book, you may be fine.if you are beginning in any of the three sports, i'd advise another book to show the real process of developing the appropriate base needed to compete without injury. Look up the titles by Joe Friel for more complete information on how to structure a training plan."
SUPERB ACTION FILM: Great to see this awesome action film out at last. Wonderful cast and rousing entertainment.....superb.To Maxwell Mattford my comments on this film being in pan & scan (I know it's not) was that the intial info supplied prior to release was that it was to be a full screen release now that it is released we know different...maybe you should check YOUR info before you mouth off
"The Wild Geese: For those who are fans of ""War/Mercenary Theme"" tales, The Wild Geese is a classic. Outstanding Stars, outstanding actions, outstanding music. It is an action packed story of men, a nations' adversities from within, and the steps taken to relieve the strife. In the guise of securing freedom for a deposed and incarcerated leader and re-establishing a democracratic free state, mercenaries are hired and sent on a mission into catastrophe. The mercenaries and freed leader are used as pawns in mineral rights schemes between a greedy English Lord and the ruling despot. The mercenary unit and the now freed leader are left stranded when their plane to safety passes them by. Now pursued, the relationships of men, ideals, and their need to survive, demonstrate the power and will that mens' hearts can muster when the real needs are the life of this leader and the freedom of his people. Retribution by the surviving mercenaries is methodical and thorough. Not a movie for to be taken lightly."
"Beers Steers & Queers ~ Revolting Cocks: Revolting Cocks is one of Alain Jourgensens many side projects and its amazing, weird, disturbing and stupendous at the same time. The lyrics are filled with rage, venom and anger. Alain Jourgensen is as crazy as ever and he has written something quite special. Tracks such as beer, steers and quuers, stainless steel providers and (Lets get) Physical are all really well done. The cover for this album is very nice and presents some of the members on what looks like an old roman coin and the book-let is sparse yet the logotype is well done and not as odd or strange as other Jourgensen albums."
"A LOT OF STEPS BACKWARDS: When I thought Mercyful Fate had stopped writing stupid lyrics about Satan, changing into more acceptable ""horror movie"" lyrcs, they go bakc to Satanism. I have no prejudice about that, but it is just ridiculous nowadays. Come on, King Diamond, and Hank Shermann: you can do better than that."
"Another Classic: A longtime fan of Mercyful Fate and King Diamond, I still spend each week wishing for the next album, usually within weeks of a new release. Make no mistake, that is not meant as a negative comment towards Fate or Diamond, I just can't get enough! These guys are pros at producing music designed for reducing speakers to piles of rubble.It has been said that you can't judge a book by it's cover, but this album cover is a direct insight into the hellish content. Last Rites was an immediate favorite, The Grave with it's crunching guitars and Diamonds resilient vocals, another great, and Buried Alive, an addictive melodic metal mix. Needless to say, this is definitely a Mercyful Fate classic."
"Amazing Book - I felt like I was there: I read this book in 4 days, it was amazing and I could not tear my eyes from the pages. I have always been interested in the Civil War Era, but have not really read anything about the civil war probably since High School. I have to say that this was an excellent book that has reignited my interest. This book covers the last year or so, and only the history of the Army of the Potamac, and does so in a way that makes you feel like you are there with the soldiers, cussing the officers along with them.Some of the parts of the book are hilarious, like the description of the battle of Spotsylvania Court House, I was rolling in tears. Some are incredibly frustrating, like Cold Harbor. Some are just plain sad, like the description of the ""crater"" assault at Petersburg.All in all, I am happy I bought and read this book, it was excellent, and it was one of those books that I wish would have gone on another 300 pages."
"One so-so song, so one star..: This record is by far Neil Young and crazy Horses' worst. No need to own this at all, not even for completeists. ""inca Queen"" is the only half-decent song here, and it's overproduced. Avoid this CD!"
"Just what I needed: Only one seller had one left. I got it,and now the garage computer is up and running again.Works like champ for browsing online.Not in prodcution anymore, but I still buy Nvidiachipsets on all my video cards."
"No tweezers or toothpick: This version of the Classic is missing the tweezers and toothpick. It would make a stylish ""statement gift"", or a nice addition to a collection, but if you just want a useful little knife you'd get more functionality with a regular Classic for a lot less money, and less weight too. This style is noticeably heavier than a regular Classic with plastic sides."
"Worthy wine-related adventures: What could be more fun than finding and tasting unlikely wines in unlikely places? Not much, and this book is mostly a joy to read. It made me want to visit some of the same far-flung places and help cheer on the valiant winemakers doing such remarkable things. One exasperating thing about this book, though: the type is a deadly combination of tiny and pale, which makes it very tough on the eyes. Perhaps there wasn't enough ink on the press when my copy was printed, but it seems more like an intentional choice by a designer with the eyes of a 25-year-old rather than those of someone over 50. Too bad, because the words and stories deserve more prominence."
"his third worst: Dissapointing. Young can play just about any genre well and country is no exception. The reason is: you believe him. He's not faking it. On Old Ways, he sounds like he's faking it. He sings these cover songs like he's at a kareoke. Worst of all, he sings with a twang that is equal parts irritating and laughable. Maybe that was his point--showing the world he didn't care. This album does kind of come across as an inside joke. Buy this album only if you're a Young completist. Otherwise, stay away. Trust me."
"Neil Young's Best Album! Five Stars is not enough!: This album is a must own for Neil Young Fans Who like country music. We also have copies of Unplugged and Harvest Moon, but nothing by Neil Young is as good as this. If you live way out in the country and have a sound system, buy this CD and play it in your car. Will make you think of the countryside as you listen to it. Listen to California sunset or The Wayward Wind and you'll see what I mean."
"Sublime.: If you've got a son, buy it just for the track ""My Boy"". Fix yourself a stiff whiskey, close the drapes, settle in your favorite easy chair, and enjoy."
"Poor quality, sent it back: This shoe rack is shoddy quality. The screws used to ""secure"" it together do not ever fully tighten. The rack feels wobbly and like it will fall apart if you were to fully load it with the number of shoes it claims to be able to hold. I returned it immediately--didn't trust it to hold shoes overnight."
"There's a Reason it's So Cheap: The instrumental portion of the CD is very good. Just what you would expect from a ""Lounge Music"" genre. But where did they find those female singers? Yikes, makes the hair on the back of my head stand on end. Would be a great CD without the vocals."
"A disappointed Christie fan: I thought I would love this, but like an earlier reviewer said, the supernatural mysteries were a bit disappointing. When I read a Christie mystery, I want to find out who did it in the end. When she writes the supernatural ones, the ending is left a bit unexplained, which I found aggravating. Also, some stories have a sad ending, which seems unusual compared with her other works."
"Great Quality, Comfy, Durable, Warm, and Versatile: My girlfriend bought me these slippers about 5 years ago and I've been wearing them ever since. Winter is when they get used mostly because they are so warm. I wear them constantly around the house and even out to run errands. The slippers have stood up to the abuse of the outdoors.They've completely held up and almost look brand new. The only thing is on the bottom the suede is wearing away a little, but after 5 years, I'd say that's to be expected.I love them so much I bought my father a pair."
"Happy with the style but the fit could be better: I looked at a lot of slippers before picking this one. None fulfilled all of what I was looking for. In the end I'm happy but I wish the sole extended fully to the outer edge of the foot to be more stable. Also if the back of the slipper extended higher up toward the ankle, it would prevent my heal from lifting out when walking quickly."
"These run very small!: I bought these for my husband and although they looked nice and cozy they run very very small. I ordered him an 11, which he usually wears in a slipper, to allow room for heavy socks for winter, and they were so tight across the instep that he couldn't stand to have them on. I sent them back. These are too expensive to not fit right."
"UGG Australia (china) Men's Ascot Slippers: You can't even get sheepskin from Australia, what kind of world are we living in. I am trying so hard to spend lots of money online....at Amazon. But everything is from china, and the reviews show quality is bad and prices full retail."
"Painfully SLOW: I was expecting a very interesting read from this book, but just could not finish it. The characters were dull and the storyline was monotonous and never seemed to go anywhere. Elizabeth Barrett Browning was just plain depressing. I kept hoping something exciting would happen, so I kept on reading, but stopped before I reached the halfway mark. Just too tedious."
"The Lady's Maid: This book was our book club pick last month. I would say only half of us read it . It was so slow in starting , I almost did not finish it. However, I loved Elizabeth Barrett and Robt Browning when I was younger . So I gave it another try and finished it. I felt it was too drawn out and very slow to start. This is the reason why I only gave it 2 stars."
Contended with this Book!: I read this Puritan classic as a devotional in the morning. A needed reminder for me to be content in all things.
strong cargo rack: This rack is strong and can carry a lot of weight. I use it all the time for work and play. The only complaint I have is that once put together it looks like it dips down on one side.
Works but mine broke after a few months of occasional use.: Mostly plastic. Can be very hard to zero. Lettering too small to read unless you lift it up near your face. Mine broke after a few months of occasional use. If you plan to use more than 10-15 times then you should get something better.
"Awaken to Superconsciousness: This book gives that unusual balance of deep inspiration andsupportive application. There's a clear orientation here towardsgiving the deepest understanding of what meditation andsuperconsciousness are really all about, but also you come away having a solid handle on how to actually meditate and make it an integrated part of day-to-day life. You get the refreshing feeling from this book that spirituality isn't just a nice idea but a very real way to be more alive! This is definitely a ""keeper""!P.S.,there's also a great companion tape available that has guided meditations."
"Lights, Camera, Sex! by Christy Canyon: A very intertesting story into the darker side of life that a few people will every travel in their life time. Christy Canyon comes out the other side I think much better off in life."
"Ted's explanation of the band.: The second half of this '2-LPs on one CD' disc is a very listenable collection of English ""folk"" tunes (Greenseleeves, Lincolnshire Poacher, London Bridge, etc). The first half (all 24 cuts of it)is a wonderfully entertaining, crisp and lucid explanation of how the instruments in a modern dance band line up, blend, and generally produce fine music. It includes an explanation of how Glenn Miller first achieved his unique sound. As well as educational, it is highly listenable."
Wrong book sent.: I order this book it was said to be a Chilton's it was Hayes. And to top it off it was for a truck
"great case: I bought this case for my relatively small digital camera. Works great...lightweight, easy to carry with the strap, and many little pockets to store things (extra batteries, etc.). It is very durable also. I would buy again"
"Right up there with ""The Best of Uriah Heep"": Boy this is a bad album. It's really not even worth listening to after you've heard it once. There are a couple of good melodies in a couple of the songs, but nothing on here is completely a good song. My guess is that Mr. Young really wanted this album NOT to sell, so Geffen wouldn't make a lot of money off of it."
"Neil Young's worst album of all time!!!!!!!!!: I had the unfortunate experience of hearing this album again last week which reminded me why I traded in this piece of garbage years ago in college. This is hands down ""THE WORST NEIL ALBUM EVER""!Electric drum kit? Please. At least it fits the trend of the '80s....his worst album would be released during the worst music decade. Do yourself a favor and save your ears...don't buy or even listen to this album unless you need a laxative."
"Doesn't live up to the hype: This is not a bad series, but I think perhaps I was going into it expecting too much. The reviews here have been so strong and so overwhelmingly positive that I was expecting a masterpiece. I didn't get it. The only two End Times novels I've ever read before this was Left Behind and We All Fall Down. This is certainly better than Left Behind (To be fair, I've only read the first one)but doesn't come anywhere near the quality of We all Fall Down. I baught all three books at one time and wished that I hadn't. This is a facinating premise, but that's all. There's no real exploration of Christian life and I certainly don't feel like I have a better understanding of my faith. This certainly didn't illuminate me or help me in that area. The characters are also fairly unengaging. Again, this is quite a bit better than Left Behind, but that's not really saying much. Perhaps if you read it with lowered expectations you will enjoy it more than I did."
"Perfect for readers of LEFT BEHIND!!!: THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY is the perfect addition for readers of the LEFT BEHIND series. See the Tribulation from the other side with an Antichrist you'd be proud to take home to meet mom and dad. He's just sooooo good at being bad! But hang in there, the truth comes out in the end. I loved the TRILOGY so much I'm going to read it again while I wait for THE REMNANT to come out!!!"
"Wonderful everday flatware!: My husband and I chose this as our wedding pattern for everyday, and we love it! After 4 years, it still looks the same as the day we bought it-- no scratches or swirls like other brands.This is a nice pattern to hold, as well. It feels good in your hand and curves with your hand-- some of the other patterns we tried did not. It's a good weight, too-- a sturdy piece, but not overbearingly heavy like others.I have all the pieces of this pattern, and not only is a nice to look at, but it's affordable. I highly recommend it to everyone needing a good, elegant but simple everyday pattern."
"Excellent product: This is a very nice sturdy towel rack. I was looking for a shiny chrome piece for towels that would allow a towel to be completely unfolded to dry properly, and this is it! I was a little confused about the ""white box"" wording in the description, but when the product arrived, it is in a white shipping box, that's it. Looks like it will hold up well through many years of service. Very classy piece! Highly recommend it if you have nice polished chrome fixtures in your bath, as it accents them well."
"Product is not as described: My poor rating is based not on the actual product, but the fact the product I received is not the classical collection as described in Amazon's product details. Rather it's a collection of popular holiday favorites performed by the Montgomery Smith [saxophone] Quintet and published by Reflections. Songs include ""I'll Be Home for Christmas"", ""Christmas Time Is Here"", ""What Child Is This"", ""Let It Snow"", ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"", ""O Christmas Tree"", ""Happy Holidays"", ""The Christmas Song"", ""What Are You Doing New Years Eve"", ""Silver Bells"", ""Merry Christmas Baby"", ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus"", ""Winter Wonderland"", ""White Christmas"". This product is only available through third parties. Be sure to verify the product with seller before you order."
"Dissapointed: I saw some reviews about it, I read some info...But I am still dissapointed.When I tryed to open his legs, they broke. (they are not metal as shown on picture, they are made of some kind plactic)Two legs broke even without forceing it to open.Now I am using it as ordinar flashlight but still not as good as any other. Light flickers (2-3 times in 5 seconds) and has very short range.Next time I will buy Larget Stanley tripod. Hope theyr quality is better."
"Great Flashlight (at first): Although this flashlight is compact it is rugged, bright and very useful in tight spaces. The head has 2 positions to adjust the light beam. It also has a high quality switch making it difficult to turn on by accident in your pocket. Review update!After 3 months the switch quit working, it is now usless. so much for high quality :/"
Save Your Money For Something Worth it: I have been using it for over a month now ... just to make this simple :at first the material felt good enough and the light was good for a small closed areaBut now it doesn't light any more .. it's more like a flashing thingyi Thing the warranty would have been useful for me except that i don't live in the US Right nowbut to be fair it's real small and effective in some situations.
Good Instructional Video: This is actually a really good DVD. It teaches you how to do the moves in a fun way. Highly recommended.
"One of Hofstadter's best.: This is a really seminal work. Hofstadter's writing is the first thing that struck me. It is fluid, crisp, and devoid of the florid verbosity that so often fills scholarly treatments (let's face it, good historians are rarely good writers).The parallels between the bust-and-boom of Western commercial real estate in 1880s and the modern economic crisis are eerily similar. In addition, a lot of the rhetoric that emerged from the Progressive movement (railing against the securitization of finance, corporate greed, etc.) is resurfacing now, over 100 years later.It's really an essential work for anyone interested in the Populist and Progressive movements. I look forward to reading more Hofstadter."
"An excellent ""how-to"" for independent investors.: This is a great book for individuals who think they are ready to break away from reliance on the big brokerage houses. Mr. Siris gives detailed advice on how to effectively use the internet to gather the ""intelligence"" needed to make wise decisions. The book also contains a variety of tips for both the technical and value investor. Overall, I found this book to be very enlightening."
"horrible, stupid, annoying - avoid!: OMG - We love Scooby but it was painful to watch this bunch of crap.My three year old watched it and enjoyed it but I thought it was so bad I refused to let her watch it again. I got rid of it ASAP."
"Very cute movie, great for kids-that's who it's for-right?!?: I have to agree with many of the other reviews in that, I missed the rest of the gang and I am not a big fan of Scrappy Doo. That said however, this movie is extremely cute and entertaining. My 3 year old daughter loves it. It does get a bit repetitive with 'suttle' jokes, but other than that, it is a very good movie. Not like their typical Scooby flicks, and that is why it is neat to see something different. Better than Zombie Island-that is awful for children. They crossed a fine line in that one!"
"A WONDERFLY FUNNY BRIT COM IN BOOK FORM!: IT'S EASY TO SEE HOW THIS FUN READ MADE IT TO THE TOP OF THE NY TIMES BEST SELLER LIST!! THE BOOK WAS ALSO CHOSEN BY AARP MAGAZINE. THIS BOOK WOULD EVEN BE A GREAT GIFT FOR THE PERSON WHO DOES YOUR EYEBROWS! I LAUGHED ALOUD OFTEN! I ENJOYED THIS READ SO MUCH, THAT I'VE ALSO READ MANY OTHER OF MS. KINSELLA'S BOOKS AND SHARED THEM WITH FAMILY AND GIRLFRIENDS!"
Wife and Mother: This is the best book I've ever read dealing with relationships. I recommend it highly if you want to have a wonderful marriage!
"Same old BS: Nothing new here, spun as a shocking insight. They push possible EMP attack as an Iranian threat, well surprise hillbillies, EMP attack is part of any nations nuclear first strike. I want these crazies out just like everyone else, but another invasion in the middle east is not the answer. This film not only leaves out critical data, it spins the same old stuff we already know into a whirlpool trying to create a new threat. Dont be dumb enough to let this terrible piece of propaganda film making have an effect on you. Yes they need to go, and they will when the people of Iran are ready. Sean Hannity spins this as a wakeup call, he must have been asleep for the last 10 years, welcome to the same old take on the same old Iran. Funded by an Israeli foundation out of NY, this is clearly an appeal to the NeoCon mindset for first strike. If your looking for that kind of dribble, head on over to Project for a New American Century, at least over there it's free."
"The Log of a Cowboy: Not for everybody but full of info and down-to-earth experiences to help you get ""into"" the cowboy life."
"disappointed: Ordered this book thinking that the positive review on amazon was a good recommendation, wrong! The book is a photo copied version of an old text, and the copier evidently left out the last couple of pages, which I felt were very important to the book. Also, the price reflects a price that would indicate it is more valuable, but in fact to me was much over-rated and over priced. Don't buy this book!"
"One of the best of this genre: This book is a lot of fun to read, taking the reader back in time to a late-1800s cattle drive from Texas to Montana. The book is written well with spare prose, wit and exceptional details about a cowboy's often difficult and sometimes boring life on the trail. There's refreshingly little of the syrup found in so many western stories. It's written simply enough for pre-teens interested in the west, yet it will yield a lot of enjoyment for the seasoned reader."
Great resource book: This book helps you figure out your figure. I learned things I never knew about altering patterns and getting a good fit. I use this book as a resource and enjoy it. The instructions are fairly clear. I would recommend you have some sewing basics before using the book.
"Guillermo Herrera Arreola: Chayito. Felicidades por este maravilloso CD. que es una selección de las canciones que más se escuchan en México, y aunque este CD. ahún no esta en venta en nuestro país, yo lo compre en Chicago y estoy facinado con el. Espero pronto tener tu nueva producción de Discos Musart ( los 2 anteriores ya los tengo : el de tambora y el de la moneda se voltió).Un abrazo y que Dios te bendiga.Con AmorGuillermo Herrera"
"what a helpless and hopeless movie: VERY artificial emotions. you see poor Sandra crying and pretending to be sad, and it doesn't move you one little bit. Even Gena Rowland wasn't acting like she usually does. It's not worth watching it. keeps draaagggging on..."
"Cry every time: As a child of divorce I know how it feel to hate the one person that you should love the most! Thinking to one that broke the marriage is the hero while the one that is in pain is the villian. This movie brings me back every time. I wish so much that my mother has a much strength as Berdie did in this film. I can watch this movie over and over just to listen to the music it contains. The soundtrack is one in a million. You can play it through and through and enjoy every song on it! I would recommend this movie for any woman that has every had her heart broken, ever been a child of divorce, or ever wants inspiration to move on in life and accomplish great things when they seem most impossible!!!!"
"Touching Movie: HOPE FLOATS is an excellent movie about finding yourself and learning to move on and have hope to live again. Sandra Bullock plays Birdie, a woman who's husband was cheating on her with her best friend, exposed on a national talk show. Although the premise of the story is a bit cliche, it was a good way to open the movie. She moves back home with her daughter, and they live with her mother (played by Gena Rowlands excellently). Birdie gets over the devestation by realizing that her husband did not define her, and finds the courage to live again for her family. Harry Conick Jr. plays Justin, a past love of Birdie's, who also helps her out. The movie is deeply affirmed in the fact that hope will float again. A lot of people were disapointed with this movie but I really enjoy it, it has a strong sense of family and a very strong meaning behind the plot. Go see it!"
"Great Movie..and soundtrack!: I was impressed! I had avoided seeing this movie for years because I thought it looked like it was going to be a really bad, cheesy, cliche, chic flick. Then one night it was on tv and I was like, what the hell,I was bored so I figured why not?! Well, by the end of the movie I was in tears because I was so moved. I can't explain exactly what it is I liked about it. It was a simple movie...and yet so touching. It had alittle bit of romance, alittle bit of comedy, and it felt so real. I was also very impressed w/ the movie's soundtrack, so much so that I now intend to buy the cd! I would highly recommend this movie! Even my husband ended up watching it with me and enjoying it."
"A good movie: I rented this disc last night and it was a pretty good movie. The performances are the best part of the film, especially Gena Rowlands and Mae Whitman. Sandra Bullock gives her most nuanced performance to date."
Could have been better story.: A thin plot that dragged on without any redemption in the end. Bought it for my wife as a stocking stuffer on christmas. Would have been easy to find a much better movie. If you were entertained by this then you obviously are easily entertained. Not one of Sandra Bullocks better movies. The effort was a waste of her talents.
"mary russell tapes: My family absolutely loves these books and we think Jenny Stirlin does a great job as a reader. (Her American accents aren't the greatest, but she reads the book with familiarity.) I would highly recommend them as great books to listen to on a road trip."
"Well now Really!: I guess that we should hand one star over to the author for creativity, but any true Doyle fan knows that Sherlock Holmes would never marry anyone. This novel is a disgrace to literature,and I am sure the great creator of Holmes is rolling over in his grave at the thought of this almost blasphemous pastiche. Not a good read. Go find the originals.... with this you are just wasting your time."
"Great Expectations: I must agree with a reader from Worcester, MA. The Beekeepers Apprentice continues to be my favorite book of all time, but starting with ""A Monstrous Regiment of Woman"" and going through ""The Moor"" Ms. King has completely bottomed out. I have not yet read ""O Jerusalem"", i will try it, but if it continues in the pattern of the previous three I plan on not finishing it. ""The Moor"" had great possibilities, but the solution is given away by the end of chapter 13. I was extremely disappointed by the amount of time she used describing the moor. All around it was a disappointing read."
"Don't Waste Your Time: After a few rather good works in this series, The Moor is a big let down. It is one of the most boring Sherlock Holmes pastiches I have ever read.Don't waste your time on this one."
"Good CD for those that liked Eighties Films: At first I only thought this CD was okay since I liked most of the original songs better, but it grows on you. Phantom Planet's cover of Somebody's Baby is the best track but the others are also cool. I recommend this if you love the eighties teen movies cos this brings back all the memories. One of my fave compilation CDs in my collection now."
"ZonePlayer 80: Great add-on device to my music system, bringing internet music and digital music from my computer to my theater system. It seems expensive for for merely converting wifi radio frequency to RCA inputs to the home theater system. Especially when I realized I needed to buy another bridge device to connect this unit to the home network. But it is simple to install and use. It is unobtrusive and clean."
"An A-typical performance for a superb playwright: although we are fans of Shakespeare and his other works, we have found this play to be below usual Shakespeare standards. Billy Shakes did a poor job of combining three unoriginal story lines the result being something may have served as shallow entertainment for Elizabethian audience of peasants, but compared to other works it fails in containing any moral or intellectual value. Try MacBeth or even Romeo and Juliet.... We seriously believe, even though it has been emphasized that Billy has mocked the place of women in society though they seem triumphant. We resent the fact the switching of the roles, which looks as if Billy were jesting them. As stated before, other plays of Billy Shakes were better and we recommend those."
"Be careful there is a newer model v3 with better cpu!: Be careful! Netgear is not telling people that there are 3 versions of the FVS318 (v1, v2 and v3)! Version 3 has a better CPU and uses a different firmware (v3.0). I feel cheated! Because Netgear sells all the older FVS318 as though they are all the same! Not the newest v3 model! What a low life company somebody should sue them. If the Netgear FVS318 has a new cpu then give it a new model number! But they don't, so most of us are buying earlier out-of-date models! Those of us who thought we were buying the latest model were being scammed and defrauded! Shame on Netgear!"
"Down where? Down there!: Hey, if you're reading this, you know what DX is about, so I won't waste your time. This tape loses a star for not having a lot of actual wrestling in it, but other than that it's pure entertainment."
"DX really should be x-ed for this!: Typically offensive WWF ""sophisticated adult sports entertainment"" that McMAhon would defend. Mocks adults, authority, and any semblance of ""pro"" in wrestling that these atheletes could represent ... lousy immodest and arrogant characters. Partial matches - edited. Frustrating as usual. Indecent for kids. Offensive to traditional values. Photo quality was fine. That is all that was fine!"
"HBK AND HHH AT THEIR BEST!: This the best WWF video ever and anyone who is a HBK fan will enjoy it especially as it focuses on the real DX not with NOA andXPAC.This ensures it is hilarious while still including highlights of some classic HBK matches(hell in the cell against undertaker,greatest match ever).We may never see the WWF this great again(unless HBK returns!)."
"WWF Degeneration X: ""Are you ready?...I said are you ready?...For the millions reading this around the world...LET'S GET READY TO SUCK IT !!!""... This video showcases the rise of wrestling's most entertaining group. From the very beginning, we are treated to a full hour of DX craziness, with Chyna,Shawn & Hunter. But after the Tyson double-cross at WMXIV, HHH takes control and issues in the army of X-pac and the New Age Outlaws. The skits, profiles, matches, the WCW raids, UNCENSORED innuendo...it's ALL here! Personally, I would've liked to have seen more skits, and a profile on X-pac, but nevertheless this is a collector's item for DX fans around the world. Trust me, it's damn hilarious. Oh, I got two words for ya...SUCK IT !!! END"
Christmas Present for Mom: The Second Half of Life: Opening the Eight Gates of WisdomI love this book so much I bought a copy of it for my 93 year old mother for Christmas.
Great shoes!!: If you are on a budget these are the ones! Great quality and feel! Do not hesitate and buy them!!!
"Dead after 4 months!: So I actually upgraded to the Bytecc 350 after another enclosure failed. This one worked great for a good 4 months or so (although I must say the ""fashion led"" light is extremely annoying). Then all of a sudden the enclosure started beeping at me and my PC no longer recognized the drive. I tested the HD (Seagate 80 GB) in a different PC and it's working fine. Still no response from Bytecc customer service. I am done with external enclosures. I am going to go with a full external hard drive from Maxtor, at least they will respond to support requests!"

"edge-of-your-seat entertaiment: If you like Taken then you will like this, it's pretty much the same story except this time they are messing with Cage. Josh Lucas is also fun to look at. Simon West is a very underrated action director. This movie is fast-paced from beginning to end. And there is a very exciting car crash. So just relax and you will enjoy it. By the way don't listen to critics' review because they want you to believe this is the worst film of all time which it is not. It is a piece of entertainment and it serves its purpose well. Critics are just so boring they like everything that's pretentious but not a fun action thrill ride. And did I mention Malin Akerman is hot!!!!! I highly recommend it."
"Leee - galize...: This album has some very creative beats which wake up your mind. The other albums offered here (ragga jungle anthems 1 and 2) are excellent as well, but Toasted has some extra flavor and innovation. Ragga Jungle Anthems 1 and 2 are good if you like to hear junglist versions of dancehall hits. Toasted is the choice if you want a pure high-grade jungle experience. Also, the album is packaged nicely."
"Great movie!: We watched this on Monday for family night. We should have got our box of tissues out before the movie started. This is my worst nightmare: that one of my children will become missing. I watched the movie in suspense realizing in my heart that this was a true story, not based on a true story but the true story. My stomach was in knots, but it was a good movie. Yes, the acting was lacking-especially the gal who played the mom. She seemed very calm and not upset at all that her two year old wondered off in the middle of the woods.The DVD contains the real people and the story behind the making of the movie. It was very touching to see the actual parents and their true reactions.This is a must see for all dads-especially ones who think work is more important then their families."
"Story of faith and a lesson to learn: The story id nice, the first half of the movie was kind of slow, then the second half was great.There are good lessons in the movies for all ages"
The Way Home movie review: This movie is not my kind of movie at all and I thought it was very boring . I didn't like the story and I thought the acting wasn't all that great either. It did have the look and feel of a tv movie. Maybe if you are into this spiritual types of movie you might like it but personally it just wasn't all that good.
"BUYER BEWARE: it's the old story of when you assume .....! I looked at the pictured items and assumed there would be at least one large suction cup. WRONG More than half way down the page, it says 4 medium and 6 small."
Highly Recommended: This is a great all around CD for listening and for bellydancing. I have performed to several songs on this CD and it's always a crowd pleaser. They are all very catchy and easy to move to. Also there are various tempos and styles to choose from. One of my favorite Arabic CD's of all time! I've had it for nearly a year and I never get tired of it.
"Really, really not a good design book: There's not a single picture in color and there lies the rub: it's very hard to understand pattern or texture without color. Only specifically black and white patterns are useable but the vast majority of photos should show rich vibrant color. This book is virtually unusable and therefore, worthless."
"Amazon delivers the goods...fast and efficient: Anything I've ever ordered from Amazon has arrived on time and in good shape. Thanks, Amazon!"
Liberace:The True Story: This book is a Great Read! It starts right from the beginning and goes right until his final days. He really was a great entertainer! Nobody could play the piano like Liberace!
"Pass this one by: If you love Sharon Kay Penman from her great historical novels such as Sunne in Splendor (as I do), don't expect the same quality out of this shlock book of medieval mystery. Her characters are bland and uninteresting, the treatment of the real medieval world seems less real than even the best fantasy novels out there, and the plot is not grabbing at all. I think she is trying to capitalize on the Cadfael craze by cranking out (easy-to-write) mystery novels that don't take nearly the effort or research that her historical novels do. If you want to read a GREAT book, do yourself a favor and pass this one by in favor of Sunne in Splendor."
"SAVE YOUR MONEY, AND...: buy the book instead. The book is tremendous!! Well-written and engaging. The movie is a piece of garbage. It's agonizingly obvious the director had absolutely no idea what the hell she was doing. AM Homes should sue!"
Cool CD: This has three really good songs on it. The Science of Selling Yourself Short is my favorite Less Than Jake song of all time. Sobriety is a Serious Business... is a cool song off of B is for B-sides. The Ghosts of You and Me is another great song from Anthem.
"A testimony to a special child written with love & honesty: I've never forgotten this book and have re-read it many times. Deford somehow manages to show how devasting cystic fibrosis was to his daughter, how it sapped her energy and stole so much normalcy from her life. At the same time, he shows how Alex Deford's spirit remained shining so much of the time, serving as an inspiration to those who loved her and who were forced to bear witness as the disease invaded her body. This book pierced my heart and soul and showed me the power of Alex's spirit - and the enduring love of her father. Few writers are as riveting to read as Frank Deford."
"Straps tore right off!: Bought my daughter a JanSport Right Pack for school. Used it as her school back pack for 3 months, and the straps eventually tore right out of the bag! We loved the leather bottom and the ""look"" of the backpack, but kind of hard to like the bag when it can't hold up to 3 months of high school homework hauling. On the other hand, last year's Land's End back pack was 3 years old and we had to replace it only because it was so dirty and soiled. Back to Land's End we go."
"Kodak Company at its worst: Have purchased this from Amazon in July 2005. In the past couple of months we noticed that the batteries were getting depleted soon after being recharged. We tracked the problem to the charger becoming defective. Unfortunately, by the time we tracked down the problem, the charger was out of warranty by less than a month and Kodak wouldn't even discuss any reparations. Shamelessly, they suggested that I should just buy a new one from their store!I will never buy anything else from Kodak from now on."
"Excellent Product: If you are looking for a sturdy, compact easy to use charger than this is for you. This charger is fine for the average picture taker that can wait the hour it takes to charge the batteries. Although there are faster chargers out there this one does the trick."
"Unstructured, inauthentic, tawdry: ""The Calling"" may get high marks in high places, but one who knows about the real life of nuns may, with me, feel outrage about it. The material seems to genuinely engage the writer and her collaborating editors. They know that so-called inside stories about nuns make hot copy . One does not get a sense of serious archival research into the history of nuns; rather one catches echoes of snippets from journalistic sources. Better read Kathleen Norris' ""Dakota"" or Patricia Hampl's ""Virgin Time"" for realism with depth into what occurs in monasteries and convents. Instead of the pages in this book on prison minstry, take a look at Helen Prejean's ""Dead Man Walking"" or even see the film. This is a poor book by ""non-fiction"" standards and merely exploits stories perpetuating images of nuns as romantic, immature, ignorant, and gullible. It is trash."
"Cute but small: The costume is really cute but the size isn't true. I am a size 10-12 depending on the product and I ordered a Large which is 12-14 and I couldn't even get it past my arm pits, it seemed more of a size 9-10 than a 12-14. It also comes with a headband (with no feather) which I didn't think it did but it is really big and I would need to take it in an inch or so to make it fit."
Halloween: Unfortunately I was unable to use this item because when I originally placed the order it did not got through. When I tried again they no longer carried the size I wanted. I went w/ a different size & unfortunately it did not fix. I had to send it back.
"A Very Merry Beatle Christmas Indeed !!!: I purchased this double-CD last year. Absolutely FABulous.If you enjoy this ""Beatles"" Christmas CD, you should also purchase another one called ""Xmas: The Beatmas"" which has 12 songs sung in similar beatle-style. Both are a must-have for any Beatles fan.Jeffrey"
"The Fab Four Gets Five Stars!: CHRISTMAS WITH THE FAB FOUR:ULTIMATE TRIBUTE has got to be one of the most original Christmas CD's in recent years. It is not only a celebration of Christmas, the CD is also a celebration of The Beatles and their music. The Fab Four's fusion of Christmas standards and classic Beatlemusic displays the timelessness of the two genres and made what appears to be old like new again. The album is fresh and so good-spirited with a lot of thought and tender loving care in each of the song fusions. It's really fun to pick out the original Beatle song thats amalgamated into the Christmas standard. As with the Beatles themselves, the Fab Four don't overplay, keep it simple, and show a lot of enthusiasm for the material. Great, fun, and original!"
helmet: this helmet is one the best i have seen and worn. very well made helmet at a very affordable price.
Take Me Away: This was great! I've always wanted a trip on the Venice Simplon Orient Express and this is just what I need to see for a preview. Trip will be in the future! Definitely get a feel for the luxury and attention to detail on the trip.
"A Trance Lover Must Have: I thoroughly enjoyed Paul Van Dyk's compilation here especially ""I'm Comin'(to take you away)...very sensual and borderline provacative, ""For An Angel""...great ""T- dance"" tune to get you pumped up on the dance floor...he'll keep you up and bumpin it with the title track ""45 RPM"" with the same high ENRGY tempo. ""Emergency"" will leave you startled as you anticipate the arrival of an ambulance siren. This culminates with a reprised version of ""For An Angel"" leaving you craving more. Keep it comin' PAUL!"
"As good as any other spiritual book: I loved the four books that I read.I do not understand why people people would criticize this book but in the same breath speak so highly of the bible.The bible has metaphors that are taken literally,it also has missing books and is mans interpetation of what God is trying to say.Hint:King James was a pervert who did not like women,He prefered little boys and animals,so his interpertation of the bible is very slanted and not kind to women at all.I will not get into the Catholic church and what they have been doing for centuries and will continue to do.I am a FREE SPIRIT."
"Wanted to like it but ...: ... I didn't.Maybe I just wasn't 'ready' for it or maybe my taste in writing and expectations of this book were at odds. Whatever the reason, I found the writing style difficult and the story quite boring (sorry, but I did). It is so very dry. At times, it read like a recipe list on the rituals and effects of taking mind altering drugs and never really gets anywhere.Maybe I missed it, but I didn't find any revelations or insights into spirituality nor pearls of wisdom nor did I find the story interesting in its own merits. I really had high hopes for this and wanted to like it but in fact found it a struggle to read and nearly gave up several times.The 5 star reviews that this has received, as well as some personal recommendations suggest that there is a very real fan base and merit in the writings. However, its not for everyone."
"A magical and spiritual journey into the mind and soul.: The Teachings of Don Juan is an insightful look at an ancient method of seeking knowledge. Don Juan, a sorcerer and man of knowledge, takes our narrator on a ancient journey into the soul. They encounter the mystical forces of nature and explore other dimensions of reality in this facinating book. Don Juan's teachings are a reminder of the magical world of the native people of the Americas, a world in which we destroyed. Walk with Carlos Casteneda and Don Juan on this philosophical journey into the unknown world of human and natural powers"
over priced...under sized!: if you're small or a child you'd like the size of these....BUT no one would like how easily we used them one time and the body of one leaked and the pillow part of the other leaked...both at the seams! Third time we couldn't even use them...we had to keep getting off and blowing them back up! Save your money and go to the Dollar Store and get one for a few bucks! Won't be disappointed when they pop after three uses!
Excellent Salad Dressing: I eat salad a lot at least 4 or 5 times a week. So I have tried many different dressings. I came across this by accident as a friend gave it to me to try out. A new unopened bottle that ended up not lasting long. As far as Vinaigrette's go this one is one of my favorites. There is little I can say besides buy this you will love it. Their website has more flavors and cheaper prices so I recommend going there. I just ordered the Zesty French and I have no doubt it will be as good as all their other dressings.
"Nice ring, great price.: I buy this for my daughter. I was tired of her fingers turning black from 'cheap' rings. This was a great way to buy a nice ring for her and not have to worry if she lost it."
"Delicious Mango flavor: Full of great Mango flavor, perfect for Mango Iced Tea. My local espresso shop uses Monin syrups and I purchased to make my own."
"I thought I liked them: I guess my tastes have changed. They were good back in the day, but I find it annoying now. I gave the cd away and took it out of itunes. I didn't even want to save the music. I'm not saying it's bad music... I just don't care for it anymore."
"The WORST money ever spent!!!: These pants looked, felt and wore beautifully but after 2 weeks the seams started to loosen and tear.Aweful."
"Video: NEVER RECIEVED IT, NEVER RECIEVED RESPONCES BACK WHEN I EMAILED THEM SO I HAD TO GO THROUGH AMAZON. DID GET MY $$ BACK."
"the more music from jonah the better: I'm guessing most people are coming across gratitude because they follow and love the music jonah makes. I'd rather see his solo act (duo if you count his r2d2 side kick) onelinedrawing live than gratitude, but I'm very excited about him being in a new band. They're not covering any new ground, but it has a lot of heart, and these guys live to make music, I wish the best for them. Offer them a place on your couch if they come to your city."
"You Have To Have A Lot Of Patience: You have to have a lot of patience to get through this album. It hosts mediocre songs with forgettable lyrics, droney vocals, unimpressive instrumentals, but with a slick production that tries to fix everything and tie it all together. Who do they think they're fooling? It's not dull, it's just difficult to like at all. If you want my copy, head on over to Ebay, it's used but in mint condition."
"understandable highest level science with cultural backg: The book covers a broad field - all parts in close connection with the others and its background in modern science and historic cultural connotations. The theoretical aspects are merged with lively explanations. Readable for the non-specialist, understandable for the average science-educated and meaningful for the specilaists, both in physical systems science and in philosophy. A top-notch guide through this topic of multidisciplinary novelties."
"a dated classic: caustic grip by front line assembly is without a doubt one of the classics of industrial. it has a cold, mechanic sound, not as furious as let's say ministry or godflesh, but much more bleak, more mechanical. the album is mainly driven by its distorted basslines and vocals, with samples, complex programming and synths layered on top of it. lyrical themes are typically FLA, with a futuristic approach toward alienation through technology and corporate control. there are two reasons i don't rate this higher. while it is a cohesive listen it also is fairly repetetive and also it sounds dated. especially when it is compared to the likes of skinny puppy, front 242 or ministry, who released albums around the same time which sound much fresher today (ministry - mind is a terrible thing to taste, skinny puppy - too dark park, front 242 - tyranny for you)altogether a good album, although flawed. recommended"
"Good replacement pump and filter: The PMK1350 has been in the 300gal. farm tank for about three weeks now, replacing a 250-gph pump and filter. It is connected to the filter bed by a flex hose, a big advantage for positioning it in the pond tank. It clears stirred sediment in about 2-3 hours.The pump motor noise is not apparent beyond about 5-7 feet from the tank, with bubbler noise.We'll keep you posted on its performance going forward."
"don't buy this: I bought 2 of these 1 for home and 1 for the office. I wish i could return them. this calculator doesn't work very well and I have made so many mistakes with thisI have lost confidence in their accuracy. Adding 16 numbers in a column on a tax form 6 times( you know add it then check it) I only got the same answer twice!!! and that turned out to be a wrong answer!!Division has similar fun results. I suspect the processors are faulty, And the battery is not replacable so it a throw-away!"
Outdated information don't buy: The information in this book is outdated even when it was published. I learned more in 2 lectures on patent law while in university. Its has been made obsolete by more recent revisions by the USPTO.
"Whoa don't buy this!: Now that I have your attention, I would like to explain why. Firstly I have owned the vinyl copy of this since it's release and the album is amazing and something everyone should own BUT these early Young releases are in need of remastering especialy if you own a decent sound system. Young has been sitting on his a** way too long to release remasters. Rumour has it he wants a certain sound and an artist has that right but in the meantime clean these up and release them for us living in a digital world. Perhaps if the catalogue slows down pressure will be brought to bear."
Happy Neil fan!: I would consider this Neil record one of his most successful and artistically satisfying works.
"Excellent Cargo Net: I bought a two of these cargo nets and immediately found multiple uses for them. Great for securing several boxes at once, or even standing objects on end to take up less room (guitars, in this case)."
"Abdo is ""absolutly doo-doo"": This thing is a piece of junk and honestly these people should be ashamed of themselves, even the exercise dvd that comes with the machine makes it look like a good workout, except that the equipment doesnt flow smoothly like it does on the infomercial or in the dvd, its stiff and uncomfortable and the ""mesasger"" hurts. I dont think I will ever watch late night informercials again, I have learned an expensive lesson."
theme music & music during the credits was....: or sounded exactly like The Gotan Project. they are a French/Argentinian band on XL Recordings & Beggars group. They have an incredible album out called La Revancha Del Tango. Chk it out here: www.beggars.com/us/gotanproject
"Good...But Could Use More: I enjoy the soundtrack a lot, although much of the music in the movie is not on the soundtrack (most notably Summer Wind, This Town, and Beyond the Sea). Otherwise, it's very enjoyable. My personal favorite is Matchstick Men and Weird is Good (a little odd, but good). With the exception of some essential tracks missing, it's overall good."
"vastly disappointed: I think the few pages of map/compass reading, undestanding and wilderness orienteering pale in comparison to all the games, gatherings and contests the author discusses.For the price, vastly overrated, over priced.I was mislead by positive ratings. Many better and more detailed books out there."
Be and Expert w/ map and compass: This book is the genuine article. It teaches important orienteering skills. The skills drills in the book are vital for learning and fun to do. I strongly recommend this book.
"Didn't Live Up to the Promises: Purchased this for my granddaughter's birthday and she wanted to try it out right away. 3 children and 2 adults tried to make these animals. Problem is it simply doesn't stay stuck together unless you make something simply like a round ball. The little plastic pieces would not stay for 2 seconds. It seems that in creating something that doesn't make a mess, which was a successful feature, they somehow made it so that it won't stay molded. All of us grew frustrated. I would not recommend this because while being no mess, it does not work well, and was no fun for the kids. Stick with PlayDoh, at least it sticks."
"Kick back with this one!: Spooky ambient tracks combined with excellent synth music; in particular, the remix of Trancentral is outstanding. This is one of those CDs I can listen to 3 or 4 times in a row; perfect for working or reading with in the background... or falling asleep to."
"Enjoyment of Learning about Egypt: I have been interested in Egypt virtually all my life, and have read many books about it over the years. The reason I bought ""Temples, Tombs & Hieroglyphs"" is because I knew that Barbara Mertz was the author Elizabeth Peters of Amelia Peabody fame - and Amelia Peters is a favourite of mine.Dr Mertz combines her wealth of knowledge with her personal style of writing, which makes reading this book just sheer pleasure to read. The book is informative, easy to read and, as already stated, pleasurable to the very end. She provides a reading list for those readers who want to pursue the subject further, and I for one, will be ordering some of these very shortly."
Great Game but 1 problem: I thought NBA Ballers for Playstation 2 was a great game. It gave me plentiful time of entertainment. I liked the clothing selection. I thought the graphics and the gameplay were great. The only problem that got on my nerves was it took a long time to load. I thought it would take forever to find a hairstyle/hat and other clothing that I liked.I LOVED the Rags to Riches Mode and TV Tournament.Overall it is good game and I would still buy it.(1-10)Graphics: 10Gameplay: 9Special Features: 10Loading: 1Moves: 9
great fun: I am in love with Melissa and Doug toys. My daughter got Princess Elise for Christmas. She loves this toy. So do all the kids who visit us. (My 6 year old son even sometimes plays with it.) It does come with small pieces that I put up until she stops putting everything in her mouth. We have a growing collection of Melissa and Doug.
"great dress up doll!: this is my kind of doll! fun dresses to wear and try on, made well, totally durable! my daughter and i love to play with this together!"
"hmmm... well it's good and noisy!!: The only reason i bought this cd is because i had heard ""Supernaut"" earlier and found it that the awesome vocals i heard WAS Trent!! Trent Reznor (of Nine Inch Nails) makes any album worth buying!! a shame that there isn't more tracks to it... but in all it's an ok cd... just one of those things you'd have to listen to in order to find out..."
"Pros: Easy, great photos. Cons: Eats batteries, no SD card included: We bought this for our 8 year old daughter for Christmas 2006 and I've been impressed with it so far. We bought it because it was inexpensive (less than $100), has an optical zoom, takes an SD card, uses standard AA batteries, and had more than 2 MP (it can go up to 5 MP). The controls and buttons are designed to be very simple - our 8 year old had no troubles figuring out how to take stills and movies, review them, delete them etc. Aside from it eating batteries and not coming with an SD card, we have not been dissappointed. It does come with 12 MB (I think) of internal RAM."
Dissapointed: I am a hugh Chyna/Joanie laurer fan all information in this book was compiled from old magazines tv talk shows and her and Hunter's own behind the scence WWF video IT'SOUR TIME. This book did not produce any new information on her life. All it did was skim the surface and use other peoples' work to make this book. I hope the author shares his royalities with all the other writers and talk show host that provided him with their information
"Also eagerly awaiting the next installment....: The reviewer who awarded this book one star obviously never glanced at a traditional stanza of ancient Egyptian poetry, where you will often find references to various gods ""in this Your Name of"" followed by the name of another god (i.e., ""O Isis, in this Your Name of Mut...."")! The importance of the ren -- or the name -- is not of Rev. Siuda's invention; it's a common theme in Egyptian theology. It will be very interesting to see the next installment of this work -- I'm looking forward to it after this one!"
"Works great: Nice holster for hip placement, leg tactical, and shoulder via attachments. It fit my model perfectly and was easy to use, very high quality construction."
"Solid Construction, Secure Release: I am using this for my Beretta PX4 Storm 9mm full sized pistol and it works great. The secure release lock works as advertised and allows for a quick draw once you are familiar with it. What I really like about this holster though is that its lightweight and solidly constructed. I would recommend this to anyone who owns the Storm."
Excellent and detailed reference: The coverage of the topic is broad and deep. It is one of the few introductory books that devotes some space to transfer function modeling and does so intelligibly.A must have for the novice as well as those more familiar with the topic that need a solid reference.
"Too difficult to figure out how to use: They should provide a user manual with these things. I could not for the life of me figure out how to work it. Also, as others have mentioned, these are $5.00 at Staples the store, so unless gas goes to $10.00 a gallon you should just pick one up there. Make sure they show you how to use it though.***Update***After many phones calls to Staples 800 number we figured out I actually received the significantly less common ""Hard"" button that requires reciting a 64-bit encryption key and whistling the Star Spangled Banner in its entirety before it will state ""That was Hard."" Due to a mix-up at the plant my ""Hard"" button was accidentally stamped with the ""Easy"" button logo. Explains a lot!"
"Upbeat and fun to listen to with catchy lyrics!: The song ""I feel like singin' along"" has an upbeat pace similar to Hank Williams Jr style, and a hint of Merle Haggard with well-thought-out lyrics...I certainly like to sing along!! Even though I personally prefer upbeat tunes such as the above-mentioned, and ""Runaway Cadillac"", and many more, the song ""Big in the Heart"" seems truly from the heart, and is very enjoyable. I'm now a great fan of this artist! Jenneye Shugar drcoffee@kdi.com"
"Studio techniques is too shallow!: After reading some of the instructional texts on Photoshop after I bought this book, I found that as much as Ben Willmore claims that he did not want to write a ""Step by Step"" approach, the book is way too thin on the inner workings of Photoshop 5 to be of any real value. There are better texts out there that teach more of what's going on in the program. Plus, the include CD is useless ( nothing there to follow along with the sparse examples throught the book.)"
"Great series for young readers: I, too, enjoyed Daughter of Wolf House and many other books written by Margaret E. Bell. I read and reread these books as a teen, and found them very appealing. The central characters were strong girls/young women, who were growing up in the wilds on coastal islands of the Pacific Northwest in the late 1800's. Ms. Bell wrote both from the point of view of a young white girl, and from the Native American/First Nations perspective as well. I would love to see these books become available again, so newer generations of young women could read about the pioneering spirit of 100 plus years ago.I wish that my daughter had had the opportunity to read these books, but they had disappeared from library shelves by the time she would have found them interesting."
"This game is a real slap shot!: This NHL game is a blast. I didn't like the previous NHL Hitz titles because of the larger-than-life players, only 4 men on the ice, etc. This latest version is a real improvement. Regulation 5 men on the ice, realistic player sizes, and lots of fun to play. I have tried all the 2003-04 NHL games and I enjoy this one the most.p.s., GO SHARKS!!"
"Ridiculous piece of self-flattery from a bogus author: I am a licensed psychologist and have read several books that I would deem useful for my clients - THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM!! For anyone seeking practical advice from a truly gifted therapist and author, do yourself a favor and pass this book by. Just read the cover and look at the picture and you will see that this book is not written for the purpose of helping others, but for self-promotion for an aging therapist. In addition, several of this author's ""credentials"" have been achieved through mail order training programs. For those of us who are truly invested in helping others help themselves, I would say keep your money and donate it to a more worthwhile cause."
"v. disappointed with the sequel: Nothing at all like the first book. What did she do, watch the Claire Danes movie and decide to put Bridget in the role?"
"Not As Good As The First: ""Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason"" picks up 4 weeks after ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" left off. Bridget is now in a relationship, but the honeymoon is definitely over, and they're with each other. Bridget is still concerned with her weight, and is whining just as much as usual.While this was a good book, I enjoyed the first one much more."
"Disappointment to intelligent readers: I was so looking forward to the new adventures of Ms. Jones after finding her to be a loveable and indentifiable character in the previous book. However, Edge of Reason has turned her into a characature of an altogether rediculous human being. Her adventures are not the slightly blown versions of the real thing, but plain outlandish (Thai prison, naked youth with rabbit in boyfriends bed, death threat, etc). Unfortunately, this book came off as a hurried attempt to reap in on the profits created by the first Jones book. Surely most fans of the original novel will find it a sad sellout, and a poor representation of the character they have come to adore."
"This Book Is So OVERRATED! Don't get taken in!: Am I the only person in the world who is sick of hearing every new book compared to the Bridget Jones Diary? Reviewers have even shortened the book title to BJ or BJD. For as much praise the book is getting, you would like that an unpublished Jane Austen manuscript.Don't get takeninto the Hollywood hype. This book isn't that great! Pick up a copy of Jane Green's Mr. Maybe. Or if you have to, rent it on DVD. Atleast you get to look at Hugh Grant and Colin Firth for your money."
"Bridget's back!: I read the first book a couple of years ago and really loved Bridget, the lovely and neurotic singleton that all of us root for. And before the second film comes out, I wanted to read the second book and get my own take on it before the film makers produce their version. While ""Edge of Reason"" is not as good as the first book, it still holds a lot of humor and charm for the reader. While Bridget has her man, there are lots of bumps in the road...naked chinese boy in Mark's bed, being stuck in a Thai prison and her Mum's new friend, Wellington, met while she and Una made a trip to Africa---to name a few. You can always count on Bridget to get in some pretty bizarre but funny predicaments. A good and easy read. Make time for it and you are guaranteed some laughs!"
"V. Fabulous: Totally loved it, and hope Helen keeps them coming. Like everyone else said, I could totally relate!"
"Simply hilarious!: In short, this is the best sequel I've read. It's witty, honest, warm and romantic."
"Lost potential: THE EDGE OF REASON and Frank McCourt's 'TIS are classic examples of what gets lost when the authors are rushed into supplying sequels. Both of these books had enormous potential, and both fell extremely short of their mark. This Bridget is a whiner and her airhead friends are hard to tell apart. The mother/daughter relationship which was so lovingly and comically described in THE DIARY becomes flat and stale here. Although the comedy sometimes hearkens back to the high-giggle level of THE DIARY (witness the screamingly funny interview with Colin Firth and Bridget's plane ride to Thailand), much of the comedy also falters. The plot needs to be shaped into more of an arc. I agree with other reviewers who say that this book needs to be edited--and I don't mean just correcting the spelling of the First Lady's name."
"As good as the first one !!!: The Edge of the reason is as good as the 1st diary. We can find the same kind of humor again...But it is not boring, or repetitive. Bridget now is trying to make her relationship work with M. Darcy, with the help of self- books ... and her trip to Thailand is again a new adventureI would suggest to read the first one first ... because lots of elements will be easier to understand"
"Buy Something Else!: I read all the reviews before buying this hoop. I appreciated McElligot's review. Thanx for taking the time to write that, it helped a little. First of all I NEVER write reviews, but I thought I would take the time today. STAY AWAY from this product! It is poorly, cheaply, and horribly built and designed. I have put together swingsets before and they weren't this bad. It doesn't help when you get someone else's return either, that they managed to mangle! How could I tell you that? Well, maybe because of the hair on the pipes, or maybe it was the bent (hoop pipe) that was sent with the product. Maybe I just watch too much NCIS! I decided to go with it and assemble it anyway, just because I don't want to bother with a return. Overall review: I bought this hoop preparing for the worst. It wasn't the worst, only because the product looks cool when you manage to fight and get it assembled. Is it rocket science, NO. But try and build a log cabin with match sticks! I'm Out!"
Excellent Book !!!: I own the book of Hammond Citation World Atlas b/c I had to buy it for a recreation class in college in the past. When I got done with that recreation class with the Hammond Citation I went ahead and kept the book instead of sold it back to the college book store since the book was very helpful to me in the future! I can alway use that book to look up what city/town or village population and etc. Kim
"Drop 2 and get the new: With the departure of the original guitarists, Decide creates one of their best albums to date. There is a real different feel to the album, even thought eh listener can be sure deicide is cutting away when its turned up. The solos and bridges are very well blended. There was great work on this album. Its intensity can't be reached without going back to the first few albums."
"Buy Conair Spiral curling iron instead: I purchased this one when my Conair spiral curling iron broke after 4 years. This Revlon curling iron does not get near as hot as the Conair and does not achieve near the curls as the Conair as the result. Don't waste your money on this one, buy Conair Spiral curling iron instead! :)"
"Pointless and Misleading: If you want to consult the First Folio, get a facsimile. Freeman's ""editions"" are not only pointless, they are profoundly misleading: only someone who was completely ignorant about Jacobean book-production could possibly suppose that the vagaries of F1 represent a meticulous adherence to Shakespeare's intentions. In the matter of lineation, for example, Charlton Hinman long ago showed that compositors would divide their copy into lines to suit their own convenience -- i.e. to take up more or less space as the process of ""casting off"" required."
MAKE IT STOP!!!!!: HONESTLY... IM DISSAPOINTED IN DIDDY. THIS CD IS CRAP AND I THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE PUT TOGETHER SOMETHING AMAZING. THE ONLY THING AMAZING ABOUT THE ENTIRE THING IS SARA. SHE HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE. SHE SHOULD HAVE GOT OUT WHILE SHE HAD THE CHANCE AND BECOME A SOLO ARTIST. PLEASE... PLEASE... DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. ITS SOOOO NOT WORTH IT.
"No pictures: The text is fine and the book is free, so that's good. But the charm of Beatrix Potter is in her illustrations which this version of the book does not include."
"West Federal Taxation: West Federal Taxation was a textbook for a class I was taking in preparation for the Certified Financial Planner's Exam. While I got an A in the course, it was no thanks to this text book. In some areas the text seemed to ramble and skip around a lot making the subject matter difficult to comprehend. Then again, we are talking about the bureaucratic nightmare that is the US Tax Code. I found I needed to supplement the material in this book with tutorial materials I found on the IRS website to gain better comprehension. If you're stuck using West Federal Taxation as a textbook I would suggest you become familiar with the IRS website to really learn the subject matter."
"Works!: What can I say about a pet feeder? It's great if I'm going away for a few days and want to make sure my cat has plenty to eat. However, if I leave it there all the time, he turns into a pig and just keeps eating and eating."
"SUPERB DVD PLAYBACK ON ANY TV -ESPECIALLY HDTV: I just purchased my second OPPO 971H, the difference in quality between this unit and my standard DVD players (Sony and Panasonic) is astounding. Upconversion makes a huge difference even on a standard def WEGA."
"Great for NTSC, not so for imports and PAL conversion: The DVI instead of a HDMI is a hassle, you can't get the HDMI gamut even with an adapter cable, you are stuck with DVI.Forced subtitles cannot be removed!NTSC upscaling works well, better then any other player I own. Many PAL discs are jerky when upconveted (try watching credits), going down to 480i fixes this on other similar chips, I haven't tried it on my Oppo.Pal to NTSC conversion isn't so great, the audio often loses sync.REGION CHANGING INSTRUCTIONS1. Press Setup on remote control to access the setup page2. Enter 9210 on the remote3. A service menu will pop up4. Select a region: 0- 6 in region code. 0 is all-region.5. Press Setup on remote again to exit"
"Good Quality Player for a great price!: After using the player for 4 months, I've experinced no problems and it has played all of my DVD's,divx,avi's,etc. Still having troubles really determing the difference between HD-up converting through DVI or HDMI and regular component video output. Aside from that I'm happy with the purchase."
the only thing that worked for the tear stains!!: it works awesome!!! tear stains are so much better and my dogs dont mind the taste at all!!!!
"A different Method to administer: I have used this product for over a year. It works fine. In the beginning she would take it on her food. But then she would not eat her food with Angels Eyes on it. She is fussy. So after I threw out some food I discovered that if I take the powder in a small dish and mix it with a few DROPS of water, roll it up into a ball she takes like a treat every time. If you have problems feeding it to your pet try this. Do not use very much water just a drop or two. Works great."
"No big deal: I started using this product 1 month ago on my Maltese following the product instruction. So far, I cannot see the difference on my dog's tear stain. When I exhausted my supply, I will not buy another bottle again."
"Angels' Eyes Tear-Stain Eliminator: The product works great. We have seen a noticeable difference in a short period of time. We have a dog who was abused and bites when she is nervous. We were having a hard time keeping her eyes clean, now it is so much easier because they don't get all caked. She's happy and we are too."
"can cause diarrea: Be aware that the anti biotic in this stuff kills the good bacteria in the dogs system.. While most dogs seem to tolerate it others do not. Ours started having black runny stool after only a few days. It will take away the tear stain!! I have to admit. We have tried several products, the best being Tear Stain Supplement from Petsmart. At only $9.00 its a bargin, and only a third the cost of angel eyes."
This stuff works!!!!!!: We've tried lots of things for tear staining prior to Angel Eyes. Within one week we could see a 50% reduction. In two weeks the stains were gone!!! If you're sitting on the fence with this product - Don't!!It works. It's wonderful. My dogs love the beef flavor. Excllent product!!!!! :o)
"No More Tear Stain: I've had Angel's Eyes for about 3 weeks and I can already see an improvement in my dogs appearance. She's a cream colored poodle so the red tear stains were always very apparent. Since I've been giving her the supplement I've noticed a considerable difference. Her eyes still get a little weepy every now and again but I'm confident that with continued use she'll only improve. The only downside is that even though Angel's Eyes is liver flavored, my puppy doesnt seem to like it very much. If i put it in with her breakfast she's sure to finish it before the end of the day but she definitely doesnt attach her food with the same gusto. It could just be that my dog is exceptionally picky. On the plus side, the supplement doesnt make her sick, (she has a weak stomach and tends to throw up just about anything that isn't her regular kibble). All in all, I would definetly recommend this product to anyone with a light colored puppy who has problems with unsightly tear stains."
"contains an undisclosed amount of tylosin, an antibiotic.: It seems ashame to dose pets with an unknown amount of an antibiotic. This helps develope antibiotic resistant organisms. I don't know if it works or not. My vet's advice was "" accept it as part of your pet. I f you are not going to show, just get used to it. keep her eyes clean and the hair around the eyes short to cut down on fungus and skin irritation cause by constant damp hair.Yes, I think it detracts from their beautiful face, and I color my own hair, but at least it is my choice."
"AWESOME PRODUCT !!!!!!: We have a maltese , and like most of here breed she has the problem with the eye staining, I did everything I could to keep the eye staining at bay ....then a friend told my about Angel Eyes....I figured we had nothing to lose, so I tried it ...We have been using it on her since the beginning of April, and it works GREAT ....the tearing & staining has stopped .....I think this product is the best thing since Sliced Bread :) Try it you won't be disappointed at the results ....Only bad part about Angel Eyes is that no pet store carroes it...so I had to order it online ...I checked around on different sites, and Amazon has the best price...."
"Worth a try...: I've been using Angel eyes on my Maltese since he was three months old.I used it religiously for six months, but did not notice a significantdifference in his eye discharge or tear staining. Now that he is close to a year old, I am taking him to a canine eye specialist to have histear ducts punctured and irrigated. Hopefully that will work."
"Not worth the effort: I've been using this product for 2 and a half months and I've noticed absolutely no difference whatsoever. I've been hanging in there to give it the full 3 months like the directions suggest, but so far there has been nothing, absolutely NO CHANGE in the tearing or the staining. I don't think I'll keep buying this product (wish I'd saved my money), but it does seem to work for other people. Also, my toy poodle is 5 1/2 months old so there could be more tearing because she's teething, but it should be indicated on the product(which it isn't) that teething will hamper the effectiveness of the product, if that is the case here."
"works well, but it is an antibiotic - be aware: Be aware that this is an antibiotic. Would be 5 stars if it weren't that there is some potential danger. It did clear up the stains around my dog's white snout. Unlike most antibiotics it has been shown to work well over a long period. Please make sure to discuss this product with your vet. It is an antibiotic. I run annual blood work on my dog to ensure his liver is not being compromised. This works on the whole coat and helps with ear infections as well. I use the lowest dose possible to keep stains away. After a month I skipped a week (forgot to take it with me at Christmas), then found out it is antibiotic, so I restarted at half dosage. 4 weeks later and still no stains...."
Awewome Product: Have tried numerous products for my Maltese and none of them worked. He has terrible staining under the eyes. When my groomer told me about Angel Eyes I decided to try it. Unbelievable results. This is truely the only product out there that works and I have tried them all. Thanks Angel Eyes.
"Disappointing...: I have tried everything to help with the tear stains for my white poodle. So I was anxious to try this after seeing all the reviews. I have completed one 120 gm bottle and there has not been any change in the staining. In addition, my pup HATED the taste of the beef flavor. He has eaten dry food for all his life, but the only way I could get him to eat this was to mix his dry food with a little bit of water. Now that I have finished the bottle and he doesn't want to eat his normal dry food, I have to add a water in it.So in the long run....a big set back for our household."
"Angel Eyes Gets a Halo!: I have a four year old Saint Berdoodle (Saint Bernard/Poodle mix) named Sailor, and he was ALWAYS getting black ""gunk"" buildup from his eyes. He's basically a white dog and the gunk was terrible; he hated getting his face cleaned and it seemed like I could never get it clean enough. While browsing through the pet shop, I came across a product called Angel Eyes, which promised noticeably whiter eyes within just a few days. Sailor is VERY happy that I don't have to wash his face any longer; just the quick swab of the tiny trace lines and that's it! I put just a teaspoon of beef-flavored Angel Eyes in with his food; he knows it's coming and he dances around the room.Thank you, Angel Eyes!Kelley & Sailor"
"Angel Eyes: I ordered this product to use with my Coton de Tulear after I ran out of the Angel Eyes that does not have the antibiotic added (yellow label). My dog would not eat it. He took one sniff and walked away. In fact, he did not eat for 2 days because of it. Now, in order to get him to eat his food with this product on it, I have to add something like baby food to it. The results to the eye area is pretty good (not great) but it is not worth it to go through all the trouble of making him eat. It makes we wonder what it is doing TO him that he will not eat it."
Great Product!!: This is an amazing product. Just a sprinkle on their food three times a week is all it takes. Never any tear staining. My maltese has a beautiful snow white face without any of the rust or red staining that plaque some breeds.
"Angel Eyes Works: Angel Eyes is a miracle product. I have been giving it to my dog for four months. My dog tears a lot and the matting and bad smell were driving me crazy. A friend recommended Angel Eyes- Now my dog has a clean face, no staining, matting or bad odor. This product really works!"
"Angel Eyes REALLY Works: Finally a product that really does what it says! I have a Bichon Frise who are known to have weepy eyes. When they are pups, it turns the fur around the eyes brownish/black. As they get older, it turns reddish. I would clean her eyes daily...sometimes more than once a day...to no avail. Vet discouraged using any type of eye drops, but he does advocate Angel Eyes. It really works! I now use it on our Pom Mix puppy. I just sprinkle on food every other day & their eyes are clear & beautiful...so is the fur around their muzzle. I would recommend this product over & over. Do buy it on Amazon.com as it is the cheapest place."
"Good So far: I read all other reviews and tried out this product with a hopeful approach. Some dogs do not tolerate this well and my dog has a sensitive stomach. I am glad to report that Angel Eyes really does work. After 3 weeks, her eye stains are 90% gone."
"This could kill your dog: I gave this product to my dog twice and it made her break out into bad hives. I contacted Entirely pets, the shipper, and they would not give me back my money. All my dog used was 1/2 tsp.-She's 5 lbs. If you do order this product, don't order from them."
"its ok: i have 2 maltese, this stuff works, but if i had only 1 dog to use it, it will cost me a fortune still, you have to put a lot in their found to get it going and still more"
"No more red-mouthed (and footed) Bichons! Or bad breath.: I love Angels' Eyes. Both of my bichons have had red mouths (and subsequently red feet) for, I don't know, FOREVER. Angels' Eyes has cleared it up completely. My Bichons look totally different. But, not to be all about asthetics, my little guys also have had TERRIBLE breath, and dental care has not proven helpful. Angels' Eyes has! No more dog breath."
Angels' Eyes is Heavenly: We have used Angels' Eyes tear stain eliminator on our MaltaPoo for several months now. He has no more stains and there are no side effects that we can notice. He is healthy and happy. People can't believe he is 12 years old.
"It didn't really work for me.: I tried this product, but didn't really have success in removing the tear stains from my Maltese's eyes. Better products are on the market that really do work. The one that really did the job, was from another online store. It was purchased from Puritan's Pride, which basically sells vitamins, but also so much more. The product was eye cleaning pads. I used the pads for a total of about 3 weeks, and not only did it start working right away, it's been about 8 months now, and the stains have not come back. Amazon should think about selling such a great product."
"No luck: I finished the bottle of angel eyes on my 6 month Cockapoo and had no luck. Her tear stains are still as bad as ever. She never had a problem with the taste though, just mixed it in with some wet food every night."
angel eye dog stain remover: My dog Toffee hates the taste of the beef flavor angel stain remover however has reduce discharge by about half.
"It really works!: I have been using Angels' Eyes for four years now on my Maltese. After trying all the remedies recommended by various sources, I happened upon this product. It is truly the only thing that worked to remove the ugly brown tear stains. Each morning I pour out a very small amount on the palm of my hand and take a TUMS tablet, wet it, then scrap the Angels' Eyes off the palm of my hand with the damp TUMS tablet. My Maltese loves this treat plus she is getting a daily dose of calcium. I was surprised and happy to find it listed on Amazon.com. I usually order it through a pet catalog. This time I was able to order two 30 gram bottles for the price I was paying before for only one 30 gram bottle. Amazon.com will continue to be my only source from now on."
"charly angel: We haven't had the product very long, but it appears to be working a little. The claim is that it takes about 2-3 more weeks than Charly the Bichon has been taking it. So far, so good."
"ANgeleyes: Seem to dry up their eyes fairly well, although I haven't seen the color (brown stain) change much yet."
"angelseyes: Angelseyes is an amazing product -- just a small amount on my dog's food once a day makes his muzzle snow white -- no more brown stains, no matter what dog food he eats."
Satisfied: Very satisfied with Angel eyes. It completely removed the tears from our Puppies eye's. Will continue to use this product.
IT works!: I purchase Angel Eyes thinking it won't work! BUT to my amazement it did!!! I have a Malti-Poo and he had terrible staining along the tear ducks of his eyes... I used Angel Eyes for about four weeks and have seen such an improvement!!! I am very happy and will continue to use the product..... It was worth it!!! Thanks
"Amazing product: My wife and I realized we couldn't stop the ""tears"" of our Maltipoo from staining her face, but we didn't stop looking for a ""cure"". And I found Angel Eyes!! It's easy to use and it WORKS. I'd recommend this product to any one who has a dog with a ""tear stain"" problem."
Not Helpful - this is making my dogs eyes worse: I ordered the Chicken Flavor which costs an additional amount because my dog is allergic to beef. Unfortunately I was sent the beaf flavor. Very Disappointing!
broke when i got it: When I recieved this item it had split apart and was broken. I was so mad I just threw it away!!!
"Fun, but slow: This game looked extremley exciting on the cover, but it isn't all that great when you actually play it. You are unbelivabley slow and it'd hard to throw objects at other racers, because at the same time you're driving and you have to strain your fingers. I also don't like what happens when you quit the race, it is very confusing to figure out what you're doign and where you're going. Overall I would say this might not be the best game to buy."
"A true Eye-Opener: This movie is great. With the recent Bush Administration blunders, this is the kind of movie people need to see. A movie that will shake you from your comfort zone just enough to make you want to do something. A must for any revolutionary mind."
"Not My Favorite: I am a devoted reader of Ms. Perry's Monk & Pitt novels; but I must say that this book is a far cry from her best. Her character development is usually spot on and the reader usually has a myriad of possible culprits from which to choose. However, this reader was left wondering if the author allowed her parlormaid to write the book as the ending was so implausibly and melodramatically far-fetched."
"Fast and Efficient but could be hotter: This blower is okay but it seems to take me longer than when I had my old brand. If you have long, thick hair, this dryer is adequate! The high speed setting throws out more heat, as expected but I still wanted it hotter. The low speed setting is great for styling if it was warmer. I have never dried my hair with this brand before. It is also lightweight but rather noisy."
"Stopped working after 1 month: I had this dryer for a month and liked it. The only thing I didn't like was that I kept accidentally shutting it off because of how the buttons are placed but put up with it. Then after 1 month of use, it started blowing cold air and I returned it."
Didn't last 2 years: I chose to buy this hair dryer because of the great reviews and comparability to the T3. I didn't like how the hot setting was too hot and the warm setting was not hot enough. I've had this hair dryer for less than 2 years (purchased in May of 2011) and it just broke--it won't turn on anymore. I've had cheaper hair dryers last 10+ years! Would not purchase again. :/
"Best hair dryer yet for long hair!: Had a more expensive Babyliss that died after only a few months. That was ""ionic"" and claimed to speed up drying for long hair (mine is colored as well). It didn't. Thought the whole ionic thing was just hype until I got this dryer. Wow! What a difference it makes in drying my hair. I have also noticed a huge improvement in the shine and smoothness in my hair after using this dryer - all the things I was expecting of the one I had before. I will never go back to the more expensive dryers. They are a waste of money not to mention disappointing. This one is a great value, lightweight and powerful and far exceeded my expectations."
"Failed in Less Than a Year: I purchased this blowdryer in November of last year and it just failed - it didn't even last a year and it shorted out! I thought it was great and lightweight while it worked, however I can't believe it didn't last longer than 9 months."
Nice dryer with a good price: So far so good. It is very user-friendly and better than I expected. I use the diffuser attachments a lot and they work well.
"Horrible Product: After using this hair dryer for a few months, it just overheated and stopped working. It was disappointing considering some of the positive reviews I had read on Amazon. You're better off with something else or simply picking up a $15-$20 hair dryer at your local drugstore like Walgreens. I did and have been using the same reliable one for several years now."
"concentrator has melted through on 2nd one: I have had this dryer for about 6 months and loved how light weight it is. I have very thick hair that takes about 25 min to dry, so that is great. But the piece that attaches to the front, called the concentrator, has melted through on both sides, I called Helen of Troy (the manufacturer) and they will send a replacement if I return this one. I will not ask for this one again. UPDATE: When I asked for a replacement, they sent me the same hair dryer again. So I have used it, and AGAIN the concentrator has melted through. It's hot enought to dry hair quickly, but that can't be good for my hair if it is melting the plastic. Off to by another brand...."
Hairdryer: I live in humid FLA- and this hairdryer does the trick. Dries fast and efficiently. The cool shot button works quickly. It's also lightweight and quiet.
"Hot and light: This hair dryer is excellent for quickly drying your hair. I am able to dry my daugther's long hair in about 35 minutes. I purchased the T3 for this versatility, but when it went on the blink, I decided to try a different product that promised the same results. This dryer provides the same or better results at a fraction of the cost."
"only worked for about 4 months !: and i mostly used it to tame my short bangs! i only used it to dry my entire head of hair about 7 times at most and the thing just stopped working. first the ""cold shot"" completey stopped working, then the low . a couple sparks came out last time i turned it on so shut it off, unplugged it and threw it in the trash ."
"Beware of sparks.: When I first got them last year they were great as advertised. Inexpensive, light, quiet and dried hair fairly fast but in 6 months one of them shorted and sparks flew out. Then last week the same thing happened to the other one. Definitely not recommended. This is cheaply made and dangerous."
"Very loud: To it's credit, this dryer is lightweight. The description of this item states it is ""super quiet;"" however, I found it to be quite loud on the high setting. Also, the diffuser attachment hurts my head. Someone needs to tell the folks at Revlon that the human head is spherical--not flat. Finally, the cold shot button takes several seconds before the air temperature drops; it's far quicker and simpler to just turn the dryer away from your hair to set the style. I am not able to see any increase in shine, luster, or smoothness from an ordinary hairdryer without Tourmaline or Ionic technology."
"Power issue: I used this dryer lightly for about 2 months (3-4 times per week, for 5-10 min at a time). It worked pretty well. But the first time I used it for over 15 minutes, it stopped working.After a quick internet search, it's apparent that this is a relatively common issue with this product. It's some kind of power/fuse issue, as the ""reset"" button on the plug keeps popping out. Now it only works on cool air/low air. I am positive I did nothing to trigger this (in the way of letting it get too hot, wet, using the wrong plug, etc.) Bummer!"
"My favorite Book, best book that I have ever read: This is one of my favorite books, heck it is my favorite book. It really is a good book for everyone and I suggest u read it if u haven't read it. It is all about social standings hardships etc etc. Take my advice, read it, you'll absolutly love it."
"This book tells the story from both sides.: I thought that it was a very good book, and I would recommend it to every one. This book doses a good job telling the other side of the story. The Outsiders is very descriptive book, S.E. Hinton dose a good job giving you all the kids backgrounds. One of my favorite parts of the book is when the greasers fight the soc'es and they finely prove to them that they are just as important as anyone else. This book dose a good job of putting things into your eyes. Jonny finely found the meaning of it is rough all over. This book also is good at pointing out the good and the bad on both sides of town. Pointing out the boys many different personality is another one of my favorite parts of the book. I really like this book and I would urge everyone to read it."
"""A look at both sides of the track from the tough side"": A glimpse in the life of a young man growing up tough in a world few of us ever know. Excellent reading for young and old!"
"Boring and Long Going: I rated it 1/5 stars in the count of it keep dragging on and didn't hold my interest during my whole time readying the book.This book was boring. I had to read it for school for my sophomore year. I felt the plot was mixed up and all over the place and sometimes I found my self zoning out because I was lost and bored.This book is about two fighting gangs one is a poorer gang and one is a rich gang. Also this book has a lot of violence, and killing. The author should have made this book to be more detailed and graphic so some of the members who read it would pay more attentionI don't recommend this book if you don't like bloody and violent books. Also if you have a lot of patients and can stick to the book."
"Look Deeper into the words to find the REAL meanings: The Outsiders was a really unrealistic book to read in this age...teenagers may not be able to relate or connect to the characters, nevertheless try to understand why these fellows in the book turn out the way they are at the end. Sure, the drugs and gangs may be exciting, but deeper thoughts were meant for this book, of which grade school/middle school/ and even high school readers may not be able to truely grasp."
"Dated, poor choice for ESL: 40 or 50 years ago this might have seemed like a topical, edgy story. Today though, it seems irretrievably dated: the slang, the bifurcated social world, the emphasis on petty crime and ""hoods"". The character's evolution through the story's traumas has some mild interest, but now much of it comes across as trite. Again, perhaps a book for its time, but for a time that has passed. For ESL and English students, there is not much that gives insight into modern life, and it is plain wrong to give them misspellings, bad grammar, and ancient slang as content worthy of language study. For ESL purposes, especially. Older readers might enjoy this trip down an old, old path."
"GILBERT W: I hate when people treat you like an ""outsider"" like you dont belong there,like there better than you but, you are because nobody is better than you.Thats why i love this book ,because it explain that.so if you ever have the chance to read this book DO It, you will not regreat it."
"The Outsiders: I thought that this book was GREAT. It was very easy to relate to, even though I don't have the problems Ponyboy does, because Susan Hinton describes everything so well. My 8th Grade English Class read it and half of us cried at the end!"
"The Outsiders - A New Perspective: This book was very good. For once, some one put the perspective from some one who's poor, not so popular, and goes through difficult times. It is a very hard life for Ponyboy Curtis, yet he makes it through. This book is also a tear-jerker near the end. I think, overall, it was a good book. I reccomend it to anyone who feels left out sometimes! That makes pretty much all of you..."
"The Best Book Ever written in history!!!!!: Omg this is the best book ever! Its is also requried that every 7th grader read it anway. My teacher read it, my mom read it, i read it all in 7th grade. I must have read it 5 times and seen the m ovie wayyy more times. The perfect book for any teen"
"This book is awesome!!!! :): I read this book for a book report and my friend recommended it to me. It has a very good plot!!! The whole idea of the gangs and the conflict was very cool. This book is a very good book and I really recommend this book to anyone, even someone from the Bronx!"
"A great book!: This is one of the most wonderful books that I have ever read. It's so touching and very well written. Fair warning: This book is not for the faint of heart. It's extremely sad in some parts. I usually am pretty unemotional when reading a book, but this really touched me and I had tears in my eyes. I recommend this to anyone and everyone, young or old. The characters are very well developed. By the end of the story, I felt as though I had made some new friends. I esepecially felt for Johnny, a character who is emotionally traumatized and who you can't help but feel sorry for. Once again, I highly recommend the Outiders. It teaches you that there is a lot more to the common ""hoodlum"" than what meets the eye."
"Let Go: This book was inspiring. It shows how little misunderstandings and bullying can easily get taken to far. It is about growing up and learning to let go.I thought it was a great book and it caused me to think when I read it. I also cryed. A good book makes you smile, a great book makes you bawl."
outsiders: the book i read was called the outsiders by: S.E Hinton. the reason that i liked this book was that it was easy to read and easy to understand.i would recommend this book to people that like reading action books.
"What's with all the hype?: This book is downright nasty and retarded. It over-exaggerates , insults the poor and brings pity to those who read it. I have never read such garbage in my life... Don't read Outsiders, unless your really, REALLY desperate. P.S- the final rumble was so lame it hurt my eyes. Pity Pony and Hinton!"
"This book was alright, not that good: This book was kinda stale... First of all it wasn't something ANYONE could relate with, the society was totally fake maybe the author was dreaming when he thought up that ""society"" and there was no real ""plot"" i think the author tried to get a message across to the readers, but the fact that it was SO OBVIOUS shows a lot about his writing skill... If u want me to pick up something leave it in there for me to think about, dont smash it on my head with a hammer."
"Great book: My son had to read this book over the summer for school. We read it together as I had seen part of the movie as a kid. It was really good. We both enjoyed it very much and I had to fight off tears a couple of times. We then watched the movie, it doesn't do the book justice but it was great to see all those famous 80's actors together."
book compared to other.: compared to other books that I have read this one is good because it talks about real life. and I also think is good because it has a good plot. and not many books talkd about kids that are young adults. and some books don't go into much detail. but this one talks about everythin that happens and how it happens.
"The Outsiders: I loved this book. It was interesting, intriguing, and suspenful. It has a great moral that many people should take to heart and if they did the world would be a much better place. You will fall in love, as I have, with Soda, Ponyboy, Johnny, and many more. The book has one part when you can kind of tell that it was written by a 16 year old pupil (and it was when it was written) because the story kind of penetrated the set stage and was somewhat hrad to follow. It is a really great book, and I recommend to everyone, especially people who do not have a high self-esteem. I need to shut up now so that I don't give anything away, but this book will always stay gold."
"I had to do this!: For a book report, I did the book The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton for my 7th grade class. This book was full of excitement. I felt like I was in the book. I liked the part when they saved the kids from a burning building. I would recommend this book for anyone who likes adventure and excitement. I really enjoyed reading this book, The Outsiders. I never wanted to put it down."
"Our book group voted 6 to 3 against the book.: HOT DOGZ: A W-G BOOK GROUP gave this book a thumbs down. We didn't like it because it was far fetched, unbelievable, and we didn't like the pacing. We would rather read books about kids our own age. The people that liked the book thought Ponyboy was an unspirited and believable character and that author did a good job on the book."
Awsome Book: I had to read this book for school and I loved it. Though everyone I know says its a book for teenage girls. It really isnt.Way it was written 4.5 out of 5Plot 5 out of 5Dialouge 3.5 out of five (Its all 60s stuff)For the people who watched the movie the book is better. The thing about it is that the I wish it could have lasted longer but it didnt.
Ponyboy Express: Well the reason i am typing this review is because we read this book in school and i tell you this the best book i have read. Ponyboy is my favorite character because in the book he always told it like it is. The Outsiders realy is a unique book because it shows people how it was back when people got jumped in the streets. I am going into college now and it is a good book to bring with me to read if i get bored. I thank my teacher for assinging the book to the class.
"The Outsiders: The book i read was called the outsiders written by S.E Hilton. The theme is about a group of kids called the greasers. The greasers are made up of Ponyboy,Sodapop,Dallas,Twobit and Johnny. There is a battle in between the soc short for the socials and the greasers.It takes place in Oklahoma.When Johnny and Sodapop get assuated by some socs one day end up fighting. Johnny kills a soc. So Johnny and Sodapop runaway so the police does not find them. And at the end of the story Johnny dies."
"The Outsiders: Puffin, 1997, 180pgs, $6.99014038572The OutsidersS.E. HintonThis an exciting book about two gangs called the greasers and the socs. Ponyboy can count on his brothers to help him out when he is in a fight. Unil a fight happens. Something has gone wrong. What will Ponyboy do.It is a great book, and full of excitment. I would give it a 10 out of 10. Don't take my word for it, read it."
The Outsiders: This is a great book to show the conflicts between the greasers and the socs. It will be a book that you never want to put down.
"""DA"" OUTSIDERS Rewiew: The greaser gang always help each other in hard times. when Johnny,Ponyboy and Two-bit were walking home,and they were about to get jumped Two-bit broke a bottle and gave it to Ponyboy to defend his self. Also, Dallas gave it to Ponyboy and Johnny a gun,money,and a coat. When the cops were questiong Dallas he told them that they were in Texas when they were really in the country. Also,during the rumble all the greaser watched out for each other. Those were some of the ways the greasers helped each other."
"Has hot guys and great story line. What more do you need?: I loved this book it was really good. It even had a hidden sense of humor. In the movie you have got really hot guys too. Sodapop was my favorite and Dallas was my second favorite. This book is so good you'll never put it down. P.S (""That was then, this is now"" isn't hardly as imprssive as ""The Outsiders"")"
Well Done: This album is very cleverly done. If you are a Beatles fan you will appreciate how good the instrumentation is and how clever some of the touches are.
"French Conversational by Pimsleur: Product was as promised - new, unused and in a sealed box. Price was excellent. Delivery was in four days. Seems like it will be helpful for our trip to Quebec. Thanks!"
"Don't be Foolish -- Get Something Else...: I brought this thing because I only needed something cheap for the bedroom. It worked alright, albeit with little usage, for about a month then quit working. I called the company and they told me to send it to them (I pay for postage) and for a twelve-dollar-and-something return fee they would fix or replace it. I then phoned Amazon and they were nice enough to waive the 30 day return policy and send me another one. It came in a couple of days but this one only worked for a little over a week. I was so angry with it that this time I threw it in the garbage, which is where it belonged in the first place, and went to Target and bought a Memorex. So far so good with the Memorex. I'm keeping my fingers crossed though."
"My eagle looks regal!: While other products may clean well, this one rinses off with water which makes it a step above the others. It is easy to use and really works well, and is especially great for brass objects with groves or decorations or designs on them. It leaves none of that dirty-looking greenish residue often left by other products. I use this monthly on my brass eagle door knocker and couldn't be more pleased. In the past there was always a residue around the eagle's wing feathers. Now my eagle looks regal! This is my #1 brass cleaner from now on."
Thirty Year Old Piano...: I thought I would give this product a try. My parent's piano sat for thirty years without brass care for the pedals.I tried one buffing session and was amazed at the improvement. By the third go around I was starring into glass! I was surprised at the ease of use and low odor of this product.Now time to use brass lacquer.
"Nothing worth sinking your teeth into: I'm definitely a fan of Laurell Hamiltons earlier works so I enjoyed her story. However, Charlaine Harris, in my opinon always leaves something to be desired. MaryJanice Davidson alternates between amusing and annoying with the childish antics that go on between the vampire couples. Did NOT enjoy Angela Knights' story-too much sex, not enough substance. Still for a bit of fluff when you're totally bored it might be worth picking up. But i recommend the library so you can spend your money on one worth keeping."
"Hit or Miss: The product itself doesn't seem too bad, but the assembly seemed like it should have been much simpler. None of the holes lined up and I had to force fit the pieces. It's a little banged up now but works fine. I'd rather keep it after all the work I had to put into it then have another one sent and chance having the same problems."
"DraZonk: Not all that impressed - wasn't the easiest to put together and I had to hammer it out to make it fit. I almost feel like it was returned and slightly bent or something. Then, to top it off, the file folders hit the bottom which is really annoying. Not that happy with this purchase."
"Great picture,,sound is horrible: The pictue is really great, but after about 2 months the bass speaker [fails] and all you get is total vibration from the bass speaker. This is the 2nd one I've owned. The first one had a bad bass speaker right out of the box. I will never buy another Phillips product ever again !! I had big expectations for the Phillips TV, but they were quickly dissolved."
"Cannot Clean It: I recently bought a home with a backyard pond, which had an existing Sunterra Filter just like the one pictured. I removed the top to take the cleaning elements out for cleaning, and I couldn't replace the top. It's virtually impossible to press it far enough down on the casing body so that you can snap the retaining clips into place. So figuring it was old and needed replacing, I bought this one new from Amazon. When it was delivered yesterday I took it out of the box and for a trial run I removed the top and tried to replace it, while I was still in the kitchen and before hooking anything up. The new one was just as impossible to replace the top, even though I could turn it, press with my body weight all over the top, and do everything possible to try to get the top in place to fasten the retaining clips. I returned it today for a refund. Don't buy this product, or else you'll never be able to replace the cleaning sponges or bio-balls that are inside."
"Some good tracks but for the most part, not very interesting: I would neither compare Vas to Dead Can Dance nor to Loreena Mc Kinnit. Their sound is definitely thier own. It is new age music with beautiful vocals and good percussion work. The melodies however remain weak and for the most part repetitious. This album is a great improvement on the first two but apart from three or four tracks, the rest sounds again like the first two albums with little variety. The album is much more produced and darker in sound but at times falls into banality. I have found that in order to enjoy Vas, I have to program a few select pieces on the CD player, otherwise the entire album becomes tedious and boring. I have friends who love it but their taste is mostly geared towards new age. People with a taste for world music might find this eventually ""not happening""."
"Spiritual, beautiful, and a bit haunting: First of all, let's address the Dead Can Dance issue. While it's clear that Vas has been influened by some of the same music and culture that has influenced DCD, it is neither accurate nor fair to paint Vas as a DCD knockoff.Vas seems more firmly grounded in Far Eastern traditions, eschewing the cultural eclecticism of DCD for a more focused presentation. Where DCD had a number of tracks that delved into Middle Eastern dance, Vas stays decidedly mid-to-low tempo, offering music that is more suited to reflection or relaxation. Some of the album's slowest moments are almost haunting, but not in a sinister or unsettling way.The vocals are lush and beautiful, and the instrumentation is appropriately exotic. Should appeal to fans of Enya, Loreena McKennitt, Rhea's Obsession, DCD, etc. A solid album."
"Seems to run out of steam: This was probably the first attempt to tell the history of the 1892 Homestead Steel Strike since the books that came out in the 1890s very shortly after the event. It's hard, in part because the basic message of the strike and its outcome was and still is pretty discouraging. I had the feeling Wolff was running out of enthusiasm for the task well before he or I got to the end of the book. I was also disappointed in the map of Homestead, which turned out sketchy and inaccurate when I laid it beside a street map of the town from that time. There were useful materials in the Homestead public library when I looked (after Wolff's book was published) that apparently he didn't look into. I'm guessing better books on the subject have been written since this one came out."
Anonymous Venetian: Have been a fan of Donna Leon since read first of Commissario Brunnetti's series. Enjoy the relationship he has with family and co-workers.Unfortunately I go through the books too fast.
"Mostly Sesame Oil: This is a waste of money. It is not pure neem oil. This smells like it only has a little neem oil in it, and the rest is just cheap sesame oil. If you want neem, buy the uncut neem oil and make your own blend to save money."
"Not so good score: Was hopeing it would be a bit better, guess the movie sound effects made it what it was. not harm though still okay."
"I can't find Roy: I've just received a gift copy of Medal of Honor. I quickly turned to the page THE RECIPIENTS, anxious to read to my grandson about a fellow Mexican American, a true American hero, a Green Beret, who, on May 2, 1968, at Loc Ninh, received over 40 wounds: seven major gunshot wounds, twenty-eight shrapnel holes, bayonet slashes on both arms, his right lung destroyed, during a daring rescue mission for a 12 man team monitoring enemy troop movements that were attacked by North Vietnamese army Battalion.Too many years later, on February 24, 1981 Master Sergeant Roy Benavidez received the Medal of Honor from President Reagan.This Medal of Honor book has little Honor excluding not only an extraordinarily brave man, but a Mexican American hero so important to myself, my family, my culture, and especially my grandson. I question the value of this book.Robert R. AvilaFormer national vice presidentNational Latino Peace Officers' AssociationRetired police officer, 31 years of service"
"Taylor is a star.: I am an ""oldies"" (Beach Boys, Jan and Dean, etc.). I never heard a Taylor Swift song, until she appeared on GMA. Wow, what a great story about a young (and pretty) girl who had a focus on her life. Glad there are more than C & W cuts to her music."
"Taylor Swift: Love the young singer's voice, music, and lyrics. It is currently on my favorites list. This is just good listening and singing along when you are on the long drives."
"Excellent offering from great new talent: When I first heard of Taylor Swift, I thought, ""Oh great, another teeny-bopper trying to sugar-coat everything."" How wrong I was. Taylor Swift's talent reaches beyond her voice; her song-writing is brilliant. Each song is clever and catchy, and the lyrics, though written in a teenage vein, touch a chord with any age. ""Shoulda Said No"" was the stand-out song for me."
"Take some singing lessons, honey!: I had the unfortunate experience of listening to this album a few months back. Don't believe the hype, Taylor Swift is the worst country/pop musician I have ever heard! If this is country then what isn't? She can't sing to save her life, the lyrics are high school poetry, and her guitar playing is laughable. She is even worse live!!! yikes. I can't believe she sells like a zillion albums, her fan base must be tone deaf little tweens. She's a dime-a-dozen, can't wait 'til her career goes up in flames."
"The Prodigal Daughter: Jeffrey Archer is always a good read. However, I did not think this was one of his best. This won't stop me reading future books by him"
"Extraordinary - healing: This book is absolutely remarkable. It is not only astonishing but also very informative and very comforting. I read it within a couple of hours and I sort of ""woke up"" moved, full of energy and full of optimism. I immediatly wanted to meet Mr. Southwood. This book will be a companion for me.While reading many questions came into my mind - I am glad there is the other very good book ""teach me how to love...."" which provides many answers in a very touching, sometimes amusing way."
"He advocates the killing of gays: In his music, Beenie Man advocates killing gays. More than30 gays have been killed in Jamaica where he comes from.His music has lots of influence there. In some cases mobssang his anti-gay songs while they killed a man who might have been gay.When asked to apologize and change his ways he wrote a song about how hewould not apologize. If someone advocated the killingof Blacks or Jews, they would not be tolerated. It seems strangethat in the 21st century the world still tolerates someonewho advocates the killing of gays. Please don't support him bypurchasing his music."
GREAT TV: I don't know what these other people are talking about. This TV is great. I haven't had any problems with it and the colors are great!
"A very good book about international law.: Beside some edition flaws (like the date issue) Malcom N. Shaw is a very good book about international, it gives a good analyze over the basic institutions of international law.For graduate/bachellor grade students it is a must have book."
Horrible Shipping Cost and Customer Service: I contacted this seller to ask why shipping cost was so high with no answer. I was charged $30.00 shipping for a $4.80 bag that the item came in. I will never purchase from this seller again and I recommend to all buyers on Amazon to stay away from this seller. Customer service is horrible!!!
Used to be shy: I used to be scared to talk to people. By practicing the book I learned how to make both male and female friends and be a good conversationalist.
"Must Read for Everyone: After being on my must read list for years, I finally picked up this book. I'm glad I did. Although this book was first published over seventy years ago, the advice and principles remain just as relevant today. Carnegie was a visionary and a people person who understood that making other people feel important and appreciated should be a priority for anyone who wanted to win friends or influence people. The principles in this book are not groundbreaking (although they may have been at the time), but are rather simple reminders of how any leader, professional, friend or person should act. Wouldn't it be great if we all lived in a world where Carnegie's principles were incorporated into everyone's daily life. This is a must read for everyone."
"Do not be fooled by the Title: This book should be a required reading in any school. It teaches you how to relate to people and be compassionate, something that is sadly getting lost in this world. If you need some great advice about life in general, look no further than this book. It may have been written many years ago, however relates more than ever to this day and age."
"A Timeless Classic with Principles that still apply today!: Although originally written several decades ago, Carnegie's masterpiece about humanrelationships is still timeless classic with principles that still apply today. Carnegie crafts a classic on how to create strong and lasting relationships with others through listening, understanding, and emphasizing. He argues convincingly that the way to win friends and influence people is to make others feel important. Simple, but extremely powerful concepts!The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking"
"A must read for all people that come in contact with anyone!: If you are in sales or any job or profession where you are in contact with people, PLEASE read this book(better yet, this manual) it absolutely woke me up when I read it. As you read it your attitude completely changes. Once you begin to read, you don't want to stop....so read on!!!"
"How to Win Friends and Influence People: The new book came on time and as ordered but the quality was very poor. The pages were light yellow, stiff, and most important of all, there was little room on the binding side so the book would not stay open or even come close to staying open, making it difficult to comfortably read. Surprisingly it was made in the US."
"One of the most important book I have ever read: I wish I had read this book earlier in my life, it is a must read for everyone IMHO. So many arguments and fights can be avoided if people adopt the techniques mentioned in the book. I highly recommend it."
"Great book!: We are currently using this book as a learning experience to deal with our clientele better. It's been really helpful in stressful situations, especially when we have a client who is not willing to work with us in difficult situations."
A very good book to increase your attraction power: This book may look like some stupid guide to get friends. But that a way more subtle than that. Dale Carnegie is a great personal development specialist who studied the way we interact with each other and the simple things we should take care of to get more influence on people. Must Read !
"Great!: This is a book that all people should read from teenagers to retirees. If you have a family, work with at least one other person, deal with people in any capacity at all this is a book worth your time to read. Dealing with people in the most common sense way possible, treat them like you want to be treated. Applies to every relationship you have."
A Must Read: I consider this a must read book for anyone who wants to improve their career or just how they interact with people. The book is an easy read and filled with interesting stories showing how Dale Carnegie's tactics can work in everyday life. I think it will be a book that I re-read several times.
"the best audio you can get: You want to become a better person, keep or make friends this is for you!"
An eye opener: It's a great book that really drives home some important messages on how to handle people. This can be a real eye opener for some people.
"Influence for the better: If a book can change the way you talk with people on a day to day basis for the Better it is a good read in my opinion. When I finished reading this book I did not notice a change, after several weeks I did notice a slight change in the way I interact with people in a good way, it makes you more Aware and lets you be more sympathetic towards other people thats why I gave it a 5 star."
"Review of How to Win Friends and Influence People: This is a concise guide in the art, science, and practice of interpersonal relationships. It is a like a users guide to what Transactional Analysis calls 'Stroking.' I first read this book in my mid 20s. It didn't change my life, as in seeing angles, and having revelations. However, it did take me from being a gruff, self centered, judgmental Hillbilly to a more compassionate, understanding, and accepting Man of the World. It gave me insight into other peoples basic needs, and a set developable skills to encourage others to look in my direction with fondness. How to Win Friends and Influence People is a must read for anyone who has any kind of interaction with any other human being, which is everyone."
"Great!: Timeless advice and a charismatic delivery make this book enjoyable and likely to be acted on and revisited throughout your life. It will open your eyes wider, and give affirmation to mankind. Some reviews are all rah-rah, but I find the book is at times gleefully manipulative and uses only the best examples of its principles in action -- there's no guarantee you will make that sale, or that person will become your friend -- but it is worthwhile information and certainly is inspiring. It's definitely worth the price, and if you order through Amazon, it was a five star shipment for me."
Surprisingly Easy Read: Found this book very interesting & I think it will be helpful. I downloaded it to use with my direct sales business.
"I recommend it to anyone- with friends or no friends!: This book will make you really think about about how to treat people. I think the best advice he gave that really hit home for me is to not criticize people, and to know how to be critical without hurting other people. I personally don't have a problem making friends, but I think we all (whether popular or not) should (from time-to-time) brush up on our people skills, it doesn't hurt, it's a process of growing. He uses a lot of historical characters to make his points clear, so those who like a little history can also benefit from this book. However, I also highly recommend, ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" by Stephen Covey, the combination of the two will definately be effective. Happy reading!"
"Need a reality check: I work in the field of abused children. I felt this book did not hold the women accountable for their actions. The author's basically gave them a ""free pass"" in life by making excuses. It does not matter if you are rich, poor, abused....you took a life ( a very innocent life that could not protect him or herself ).In addition, they did not go into enough detail with the stories they presented. Basically, they gave a few lines regarding a case, and that was it. I think it would have been better to have spent more time on a few cases including all of the history."
it was great!: hi this book was great! it is about this girl named clarice bean a she tries to solve a mystery along with her friend. read the book to find out what happens! do they find the cup? or not?
"Can't get more bang for the buck.: I'm not an audiphile, but this system seems to sound very good to me - especially for the price. I had been looking at systems for the last few months, and most of the lower end HTIB systems were missing one feature or another. This unit plays anything I throw at it - even plays our home-burned DVDs flawlessly. Future compatability is guaranteed with progressive outputs too. A great deal, with a full set of features for much less than you'd expect."
Missy E song: I also would like to know what that remix on Missy's song is playing in the club and where I can find it!! Please someone reply-thanks!!
"needs improvement: The idea of having a dictionary as big as the one advertised in this module is great. How many times have you wanted to look up a word only to stop yourself because you didn't want to open up that huge book? Even for those of us who have internet connections to look up words easily, sometimes we are not around the Internet and would like to be able to look up a word on an airplane, train, or bus, etc. The problem is with this module is the implementation. The navigation is poor, and even if you don't use it at first, you will want navigation in it lately. I would wait until Franklin releases a better user interface."
"Not recommended: Oi vey! What an odd book. If you enjoy talking to yourself and shouting at the top of your voice for a few hours a day, then this book is for you.It's not about mental toughness, it's about screaming affirmations, ""with feeling behind it.""Please don't buy this!"
"What a load of ****: Dan couldn't motive Punxsutawney Phil to look for his shadow. Where does he come up with this stuff? It's so clearly a bad rehash of other self-help books. Did he even do any research? And what makes him qualified to ""teach"" this stuff? Maybe Martha Stewart heard him speak. If companies really do hire him, it's no wonder American business is losing its competitive edge. What he professes seems in line with the moral and ethical decline of ""Corporate America."" Heck, he probably writes his own reviews on Amazon. I can't believe I wasted any money on this book. At least I'll have kindling for next winter."
"Space junk: Space Ace is in the line of Dragon's Lair and other similar point and click game play. I am not against this genre completely but it has some inherent problems. Timing is crucial to beating the game and is rather unforgiving. This leads to starting over numerous times, watching the same animation sequences over and over. I didn't find the animation scenes to be all that good or interesting; in fact some of them annoyed me. Even after figuring out the right moves to the game, I didn't enjoy much of it, which is always the key factor. On the other hand, some may enjoy the tough challenge that Space Ace presents and an interesting ride. If you enjoyed Dragon's Lair, I would say you'll find this to be an exciting outer space adventure."
"DL is still better, but..: The Sega CD version of Space Ace is definately better than the SCD port of Dragon's Lair, I will say that."
"Here's a Problem....: The book states that Curly was never a member of the Howard family. Why then, is Curly's grave located directly behind the grave of Sol and Jenny Horowitz, even though the other stooges are buried in other cemetaries? This seems more than unusual for someone who was not a member of the family. Furthermore, with a simple internet search, you can see photographs of his grave, as well as photos of his death certificate. There is no evidence at all to prove that anything in this book ever happened. To accept it all as fact is pure stupidity."
"Hard to believe: I read the book and I find it very hard to believe.I read a ton of other books on Curly which seem true.This book claims Curly did not die in the early fifties but in the seventies. But Curly did die in the early fifties as there is proof!This book does not even talk about Curly's famous brothers, Moe and Shemp, his strokes, nor his real wifes!I think this book is only a ""work"" to make money off of the famous Curly name."
"Nonfiction or Novel?: Check out the publisher's website (iuniverse.com). They describe this book as ""a novel based on fact"". Webster's Dictionary defines a novel as ""a fictitious prose narrative of considerable length"". The publisher's description falls short of true non-fiction, and implies significant artistic license at work. Indeed, it is extremely unlikely that events prior to Jackie's birth would be related with such extensive detail. Sorry folks, the book is certainly entertaining, but there isn't a shred of proof to support any of it, and even the publisher is careful in how they describe it."
"Beyond The Laughter: why, why oh why!Did I not see the reviews on this waste of time, ink, paper, binding glue and money. Wow the writer of this fiction book should be ashamed. Plus how does this go from an idea to the publisher actually printing this book. Stay away, stay very far away."
"STILL HOLDS HER OWN: Even though her lyrics are all reworkings of the same theme - devotion to a love that has been lost -, and this can wear one down a bit eventually, Shakira's beautiful voice and grittier electric rock mixed to dance beats hold their own through many memorable melodic grooves. Final track, middle eastern influenced ""Ojos Asi"" is a masterpiece, whilst opening track ""Ciega Sordomuda"" is delightfully catchy, if not slightly quirky."
"Don't agree with the Amazon review on Dónde están...?: The first time I listened ""Inevitable"" on Mtv I thought it was a great song, and ran to buy the cd. Ever since I've listened to it all the time. Then I bought Shakira's first "" famous"" album "" Piest Descalzos"" and got to the conclution that she has relly grown, as a singer, song writer, as a musician. ""Dónde están los Ladrones?"" presents a bigger variety on melodies, which "" Pies Descalzos"" didn't show at the time .Her lyrics are more mature, and with songs like "" ojos así"" Sakira proves her commitment with her roots and music.""Pies Descalzos"" (although I think it's pretty good) seems like a teen Shakira."" Dónde están los Ladrones?"" seems like a grow up Shakira."
"Unoriginal: I really found this album unoriginal. I've read the artist admires Alanis Morissette and this album sounds as if Alanis had made a bad spanish record. It's evident in the singer's style that Alanis is an inspiration, but Shakira comes across as attempting to be Alanis Morissette. Hopefully the artist will learn from this mistake and evolve a distinctive style of her own. Coming from a country as rich in music as Colombia is, this album was a let down."
holy smokes this is one of the best cds ever: This cd has it all. Shakira does a great job writing plus each song has a completely different feel. On this cd there are virtually NO BAD SONGS. I've found only one song slightly boring and on occasion I do actually want to hear even it. Shakira has an awesome voice too that really reflects the moods of the songs. If you are still wondering about this cd than i have one more thing to tell you. I wouldn't say i don't like music but i am not a superfan that can't stand not having music on. A lot of times i buy a cd and listen to it for a month or two then never again. This is one of the cd's that is in my permanent folder. It just never gets boring.
"Best Album I've heard since Jagged Little Pill: Just buy it. She's got great pipes and the CD rocks. ALL the songs are good. You won't be disappointed. (I don't speak Spanish, still my friends and I flipped for this CD.) Go SHAKIRA!"
"Christ Farley and Jesus: ever see Tommy Boy and feel joy?that's the real Jesus, Chris Farley.that's his real spirit.work hard, play hard.get funky."
"A Major Disappointment: I was very excited to get this module. I remember having had a franklin electronic bible years ago and I was hoping to have that convenience again. Unfortunately, the interface is abominable. There's no real concordance, and when you try to search, you can only do the Old or New Testament, and the presentation of results is lousy, and it always tries to search its topic index first. What a pain. I'll gladly settle for a software solution that takes up a couple of Meg, because this program is so abysmal. There are free solutions out there drastically better than this [$] module."
"Amazing book: Wow!Reading these reviews makes me totally smile. Like all of the rest, I read this as a very young teen and remember being absorbed fully in the story. I couldn't put it down. Over the many years I've thought about it often.I decided to look for it online and there it is! In print again!Any story that can engage an entire population though the lives they have led and leave such a wonderful memory must be magical. People simply must buy this book for their children."
"Dance dvd: I enjoyed all the fast paced, stepping out dancing in this dvd. The tension between the main actors plus teams was invigorating /inspiring. Lot of hard work or 'work ethic' was implied > to have a dream can many times mean hard work. I would recommend this dvd."
"The Force of Reason: A comprhensive expose' of Islam and rebukes the traditional thinking in America that the Muslims are ""just like us""."
"The Force of Lunacy: Poor Oriana Fallaci does it again, with her shrill shrieks about the impending doom Western ""civilization"" faces at the hands of Islamic barbarians. It seems that no evidence to the contrary of her wild ideas can sway her--but then, again, who could sway Mussolini, or Hitler, or Bush, for that matter, from their wild ideas?Other than pointing out the horrible similarities between her shrill, obnoxious rhetoric, and that of Celine at his anti-Semitic worst--let's not forget that anti-Arabism is indeed anti-Semitism--this book is completely worthless."
"Oriana's overview of Radical Islam: Quite a book! A lot of information not read in the daily media. Oriana brings her lifes work and experiences to bear on a topic that she is very agitated about, Radical Islam.I found her final chapter interesting, worth thinking about at length, comparing the Inquisition to Radical Islam. RIP"
Nice cute little thing!!: Its really nice. I bought it because i have always wanted one. The sound is very nice. But the middle part keeps giving out weird noise whenever i streched it....it might be because its new... Hope it will go away soon.. Overall a very good toy!!
"good quality: good quality, but too much blood and guts for my taste, unneeded, seemed to be more gratuitous than anything, with the actors involved, was beneath their level"
"One of the great westerns: This ground breaking film depicts the true feelings of the West and the desperate men who were outlaws. The cinematography is excellent, with a stunning opening and closing sequence. The slow motion depiction of the final battle is mind bending in its suggestion of comradeship amongst the gang. The close ups are tremendous and the casting of Wm Holden was inspired, also Robert Ryan as the pursuer."
"Doesn't hold up well: I don't care how much people praise this film, it doesn't deliver and I turned if off half way thru. In my opinion Peckinpah is a hack, just look at that dog Straw Dogs, pointless as well. This movie plods along,framed by the dichotomy of two old friends that are now enemies. Most of the dialogue is no better than a tv western program. Booze, whores, and wanton violence film up the scenes. Some of the cinematography and editing is abrupt and does add a jarring feel to the movie, which isn't bad. However, overall, there is little of value that is transmitted, and it turns out to be another prosaic Peckin' offering. This movie can't hold a candle to Stagecoach or The Searchers. 'Nuff said."

"This cd seemed to short change us the fans: This is one more Rosemary Clooney cd that I have added to my collection. It's really not one to write home about. Let me try to explain my less than enthusiastic feeling about this cd. I think that the idea to record a cd with the great Count Basie Orchestra was grand one. As far as the orchestra goes they did their thing. They delivered a whale of a performance. Where the real problem areas came from are at Rosemarys' end.First off, I thought the repertoire was a little weak. Secondly, I thought that Rosemary tried to be too cute by changing the lyrics on some of the songs.. This cd could have been a lot better, if it could have been more conservative. Well, you can't win them all can you? Better luck next time!Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."
"garbage: This album can be summed up in one word-garbage. She makes it well known that this work was meant to frighten [take note the warning writted on the front of the CD: Contains genuinely scary material. Use caution when listening alone or in the dark.] Predicting how we will feel toward the music makes it safe to say she intended no interpretation or subtlety at all in her work.. which makes for an entirely uninteresting piece.I tried in vain to make myself 'feel' the music, but the more I paid attention, the more I noticed how bland and incredibly cliched the attempted ""scary and evil"" sentiments are made to be.The hell chants are a sign of her incredibly bad poetry. ""you will rot in hell -WE ARE THE DAMNNED! ""This CD is really disappointing.. it has absolutely no subtlety, no intrigue, and the composition is uninteresting compared to carlos's early works.In short, don't waste your money."
"too short of a life: I was very pleased with this tv for the first two years. Great picture, great sound. About a month ago, was having very similar problems to the review here dtd July 5th but after a few minutes of turning it on, everything would be ok again. As of yesterday, no picture and no sound, only a few flashes on screen before black and repeat clicking noises from back of tv. The green power light remains.Really disappointed in such a short life. Not sure what brand to try next."
"It's a joke: Very bad selection of songs, most of them you alredy have in others Bee Gees collections like number ones or the record. It would be much better if the producers choice new songs like country lanes, or tears and remaster them. Any real fan can make a better list."
"Simply; Good and Enjoyable !!: Simply; Good and Enjoyable. Nothing that you haven't already heard before! Just a nice compilation of some of the same superb Good Old Classics. No enhancements or Digitally Remastered or any thing else, just plain old Bee Gees songs as I remember them. I Love It."
"Never Forget Your Best Friends: I give this book five stars. It was a great book, and it also made me sad. I think he will make new friends, but he'll never forget Jamie. Jamie was his best friend. I recommend this book to you if have alot of feelings for your friends."
"James and the Giant Peach DVD: The DVD won't play in this region. I didn't even know there were regions! However, ""Hear and Now"" has offered a full refund if I send it back."
"Sam's report: James and his friends are about to discover the greatest thing in their life. There is a lot of excitement, courage and terrifying events in the book. It was excellent.READ IT NOW"
DVD - Horrible. Scratched and skips. VERY used.: Horrible quality item and it is unbelievable they would send this. It was scratched and skips. The DVD was VERY used.
"Fill Yourself with Peach Delight!: This wonderful fantasy book is filled with tremendous fun for people that love to read magical fairy tale ages 8-13. This story has sad no-reason punishments and exciting revenge. I really recommend kids ages like me to read this book. To me, I think the book is better than the movie, since the book gives more details of the main idea and the movie... well, I'm not saying it's bad but, it just tells the story summarized and it's on TV. The story starts with a little boy named James Henry Trotter, the luckiest boy in the world. When James was 4 years old, his parents got devoured by a hazardous rhinoceros. The rest of his life he lives with his two evil, greedy aunts. Suddenly, a strange man gave James a pack of slimy crocodile tongues! When James runs too fast and drops the pack, it crawls into the ground. Then, when a growing peach comes, the adventure begins!"
Not (typical) Disney Animation - nearly black and white: We rented this for New Years Eve for our family to watch together. We only watched maybe the first 20 minutes - none of us were enjoying it. The promotional poster/picture they show is NOTHING like the movie animation - the movie is nearly black and white - very very little color except the peach. The first 15 minutes or so are real people then it morphs into a Tim Burton typical cartoon-like animation. Blech. If it looked like the picture they advertise the movie with and had vibrant colors like that - mixed with typical Disney and/or Pixar animation it would have been a fantastic movie but no one wanted to watch it the way it is. I don't recommend. This version was creepy and the lack of color was depressing. Hoping Pixar picks up James and the Giant peach - think they could make a fantastic version.
"Perfect for Children; Fails to Entertain Adults: All children should see this, better yet -read it. The book was actually read to my class by our fifth grade teacher and our imaginations really soared.The movie is a let down from the world I imagined. Also, this movie is not suitable for adults. It hardly held my attention, the songs are weak, and there is very little (if any) embedded adult humor.Adult Burton enthusiasts should avoid this movie."
"THE REAL THING: I was born in Brazil, but my parents were Italians. So we spoke only Italian at home. I've been married for 10 years now and my wife was always complaining about how difficult it was to speak Italian. She claims that she understands almost everything when she hears my mother and I talking, since Italian and Portuguese are similar in many ways, but she is very shy in trying to speak with us. She had some classes in a language school some years ago but talking remained very hard. Not anymore, since she put her hands in this Pimsleur Conversational Italian. She is very happy, always greeting me with some new word or expression she just heard and learned. It really works, I can check it almost every day."
"Defective: Overall a very nice case. Fits an SG special very nicely with adequate support of neck and body. I have no doubts this case would protect the guitar in flight. However, the first time I picked up this case the plastic handle shattered. The handle on this model case is not field serviceable. No matter how nice the case, it is useless to me with a broken handle that I cannot fix on the road."
"Garmin 201 Forerunner: This is a great motivator for every single run. Provides a much better idea on how far, long you've been running. Have been improving my pace consciously since I've bought the Forerunner.Only thing missing is heart rate option.Maybe one day they'll put an mp3/ipod chip in there too."
"Customer beware: A word of caution.I bought this product in the US.Only to find out upon received it in Europe that it will not work w/the included power supply.So no option but to buy an extra power converted 220V at $ 30+.Is this what it's called a ""personal, portable device""? if it will not work where is needed?Garmin take care of your customers, I for one will not return."
"A Great device for the money!: I recenty purchased the Forerunner 201 and have been very pleased with its performace and overall ease of use. I've used it in both CA and Colordo and have yet to have any problems with getting and keeping a signal. In fact, I've used it in my car and have no problems keeping the signal even on a cloudy snowy day. Overall it has delivered on all the features it promises. I read many of the reviews prior to purchasing and was somewhat concerned about the loss of signal that some others have experienced. Needless to say I have not encountered that problem at all. I have been an avid runner for 20+ years and this is truly a remarkable product for runners of all types!Happy running!"
"Replaced and works well!: UPDATED SEE BELOW:This was a useful device but it broke within 3 months of my purchase.After 3 months the forerunner stopped working all together. Reset, upgrade firmware, and other suggested fixes do nothing.I have emailed Garmin hoping for support, more than 2 weeks have passed with nary a response.Beware there seem to be a lot of faulty/poorly constructed units out there. Going back to my timex GPS watch for now.UPDATE: Garmin contacted me and eventually replaced the unit. The replacement has worked well for many hours of running. I would now give the unit 5 stars. It is great to have all of the data from all of my runs. Plotting it on google maps is a neat feature."
"garmin forerunner 201well worth it: Bought this for my husband who is training for a marathon, he loves it especially the feature that keeps him on pace with the time he needs. It has options for what you want to track and stores the info so you can track it on the computer. I recommend this for anyone in a training regimin, I think you will be happy with it."
Excellent product: What a great product! I downloaded the newest software on the garmin site and have had no problems at all with the gps signal. What a great device! It is a must for both the casual and avid runner! Very easy to use! Updated software is available online.
"Garmin Forerunner 201: I bought my Forerunner about 3 months ago and have been very disappointed with it. The main problem is it's tendency to lose the satellite signal. If you intend to use this for trail runs....forget it. Even running along a road with trees next to the shoulder is enough to drop the signal. Once that happens, it tends to be wildly inaccurate. Eventually, I found that I was using it as a stopwatch with a large display.......until yesterday. I decided to mount it on the deck of my sea kayak and do a long paddle. THAT is what it's suited for. Terrific speed and distance accuracy because the sky is unobstructed.I don't know whether it is just the nature of a GPS to lose a signal with a tree canopy or that this particular model is not sensitive enough. In any case, if you intend to use it for running, think twice before plunking down your money."
"hard to charge after a while: I am absolutely addicted to my Forerunner 201. After a year or so, the contacts became worn off, so it was difficult to charge. I owned mine for almost two years and it has died completely on me. I miss it."
"Industry Group: Bad Enough their first album Sold Tons Of Records.but then Smooth With Rob Thomas&Santana Took Off.what a Bad Joke.this Album is a Cross Between Hootie&The Blowfish,Blessed Unions Of Soul&Collective Soul.In Other Words Industry Manufactored.Rob Thomas Can't Sing.The Music has Been So done so many times already.Nothing here stands out.The Instrumentation has No Life nor Does the Writting.but this is the kind of Banal Material that is selling nowadays what a Sad Day?"
"Great Softrock: If you are into softrock you will probably like Matchbox 20's 2nd CD, Mad Season. I have listened to a few songs from their first album (Yourself or Someone Like You), and this album is similar, but it does have a different sound. Mad Season is a tad softer than the previous, so people who like hard rock should look somewhere else. This is definitely NOT a hardrock album. The new sound can best be described as softrock with a bit of jazz/blues put in for good measure (don't worry, it isn't pop). I personally love it, but listen to the samples before buying because it is different than Yourself or Someone Like You.Softrock lovers--go get it now! You probably won't be disappointed."
"Just like fine wine: Seeing it took the boys of Matchbox, five years to come back with another album, I knew to expect something different, but wowsa. I hadn't realized how different! If you are expecting the same hard driven songs as on Yourself..prepare for something totally opposite. Although, at first I was disappointed. I wanted to hear another ""Back 2 Good"" so bad. This album has just as many good songs, such as ""You Won't Be Mine"", ""Bed of Lies"" and ""Angry"" I can only say I hope that it doesn't take them another five years to come out with another great album, but if that's what it takes, I'll will be waiting."
"Great album!!!: I bought this album because I'd heared 3 songs from it on the radio and I liked them. My favorite songs that i hadn't heard on the radio were Last Beautiful Girl (because that's always how I feel after a guy that I have a crush on is mean to me), Rest Stop (Whenever I hear that song I can clearly picture the girl stopping the car in the middle of nowhere and telling Rob to get out), The Burn (The lyrics in that song describe how I feel on a bad day), and Bed of lies (kudos to the orchestra for playing so beautifully). I advise any alternative or regular rock fan to buy this album if they can handle the emotional stuff."
"Great, just stay away from the radio and TV: This is a great CD and I'd rank it right with the first one. However, stay as far away from your TV and radio as you can. ""If You're Gone"", ""Bent"" and etc. are songs I just have to skip on this CD now because I've heard them 9 million times. And that's probably not that far off from the real number... still, recommended."
"Better than their first: When I bought this cd, I was expecting a few good songs, like the first, but what I came away with was an album in which every song was good. Each song told it's own unique story and the group showed that they can cover a wide spectra of music. From the ballads ""Bed of Lies"" and ""Last Beautiful Girl"" to the faster-paced songs ""Angry"" and ""Mad Season"" to the chicagoesque trumpets ""Black and White People"", this cd covers it all in a way only matchbox twenty can do. It looks like the group will avoid the fabled ""sophomore slump"" that most bands go through (with their second album), and be just as successful as they were with their first. The album is a must have."
"mad season: This album gets very boring. After hearing Bent millions of times on the Radio, MTV, parties etc., this cd kinda sux. I dont recommend buying this."
"Wow, they can spell: OK, i admit the first album was pretty good (real world was a good song, the rest were all eh) but this album? dear GOD rock is dead. spelling out your name doesnt make you deep o talented, and this is pretentious, empty, cold, mechanical rock and roll. this has no soul, and nothing behind the lyrics. they're disturbingly empty. theyre right down there with creed, and even nysnc, who at least dont pretend to have talentGOOD BANDS: nirvana, everclear, ramones, hole, and HUNDREDS MORE. listen to some good music for a change"
"Fabulous!!: This album is sheer class. I bought Yourself Or Someone Like You after hearing about 10 seconds of 3am. Ten seconds was all it took for me to become an enormous fan of this excellent group. Every single song is exceptional, there are no bad ones whatsoever. Special mention should go to Bent and Mad Season, however. I would recommend you buy this if you are a music fan, never mind a fan of the group, it really is brilliant."
"Radio friendly music for the new decade....: As good as MB-20's first CD is, this one is better. All the tunes are catchy and stick in your head. I really like the slow tune ""If You're Gone""; Rob Thomas's voice shows a lot of emotion in that one."
What were they thinking?: This new offering from Matchbox 20 is nothing like their 1st album. They have definitely gone over to the dark-side of soft rock. It is way too mellow for my taste.
"Not as great as the other one's: When I herd ""mad season"" I said to myself ""this is machbox 20? "" becuse it was slow music not the speed as like the one before! ""I did't like it"""
"Not what quality I'm used to from Acorn!!: I have an ancient pair of Acorn slip-ons that I just cannot throw out because they are my absolute favorite casual shoes. They are in great condition, for around the house and yard-just looking rather frayed on the fabric and beat up on the leather. I needed a new pair that I could wear in public. Thought I'd try these as they most resemble my favorites, but they are really flimsy and will no way last as long as my old pair. Why, oh, why do you keep obsoleting really great models??? I'll keep watching for ones like this with nubuck and thicker soles. I'm not bothering to buy, until I see the clogs that you made before, I don't want to be disappointed by a favorite shoemaker!"
"Goofy Waffle Maker: I had purchased this on price alone and while it provided many years of trouble free service, the waffles it produces are not the Belgian style that most people are used to. Even with a variety of batters it didn't produce a pleasing waffle. Spend a few extra dollars and get yourself a proper waffle maker."
"Perfect sound: Suberb sound. An example for DVD-music. Beautiful ambience. The music follows the typical Cuba sound so it does not follow the original sound tracks as recorded on his previous albums (like ""live in London""). Therefore, it may be dissapointing, however I think it is refressing. Listen first on amazon.com to get the flavour of this album before you buy it. Compare it with ""Simply red - live in London"". Unfortunately the sound on this album is not that good and the camera-work is really bad but it contains a lot of good tracks."
"don't waste your money: the plastic pieces of this hoop straightened out after a short period of time (in a few short weeks), making it impossible to put back together in the circular shape they came it. A COMPLETE waste of money. The plastic was not meant to curve and only stayed curved temporarily."
"Excellent American Bird Reference: The color plates for this book were made before the War. It blends the scientific with the popular facts on birding. I chose this book for the detailed color plates in which to paint birds. It contains the life, history and pictures of each bird in all phases of life. I would recommend it for begining drawing as well."
"Cracked 1st time: I got this piece and couldn't wait to try it out. In the oven it went at 325 degrees and BOOM, crack. To say I am disappointed is an understatement. I would return it, but it is a broken dangerous mess."
"Good quick read: A very nice book, probably not as good as his nine Bernard Samson novels, but still a nice read. It has the usual globetrotting spy aspects and is done in a way that only Len Deighton could pull off. If you are a fan of deightons this is sure to please."
"Don't ever purchase from this place.: I bought this early December of 2006, hoping it will arrive in time for my daughter's birthday on the Dec. 28th. Weeks and months later... it never delivered. It's 02/08/07 and I decided to have them refund my money. I don't understand why they ask if I want a refund or a reship when they turn around and tell me that it's out of stock. I think it was NEVER in stock to begin with. DON'T buy from them EVER."
Good Item to have for sp: This is good product to have dont get me wrong but they should have made a flame and onyx color but i understand but it is a good kit to have to be listening to the radio and playing super mario bros 3. now i bought a ultimate pak and it was only $50.00 and it is a whole lot better.
"Awful Movie and Video To Boot: Everybody knows that this MAY be even worse than ""Plan 9"" or ""Manos The Hands Of Fate"" and it is. The only problem with this Alpha Video release is that the source print is the worst I have EVER seen. I cannot believe a better print was not available. Avoid this and go with the DVD from Image."
"Bevare!: Cool title, Tor, looks like a winner, right? Don't be fooled. I love Robot Monster, etc., and truly believe that Ed Wood Jr. is a far superior filmmaker to Lucas, Speilberg, et al., but even for a fan of this kind of thing, this one is excruciating. By all means buy it for the cover so friends will think you're outre hip or whatever, but do not actually watch it or you will hate yourself."
"Dangerous side effects: My doctor gave me Thorne Profusia-SR to improve my circulation and, though I felt good for about two hours after taking Profusia-SR, it began a series of scary nighttime heart and breathing episodes that nearly had me in the ER! My pulse and O2 saturation were jumping all over the place. I had many palpitations and felt more weak and tired than ever! Then when I stopped the Profusia-SR, the symptoms continued for another couple of nights. I will never take it again!! People with any prior heart issues beware!!"
"The title is accurate--plain.: I was not impressed. The book read ""just ok."" It filled up reading time, though I would have liked a more fulfilling book. I suppose the mundane bits of life do have a story that can be told. I guess I'm not into average liturature. I must say that the veterinary sceene was graphic, detailed, and far too extensive. I wonder if the author missed a calling?"
"Literary critics seem to like things that are depressing.: It's interesting to me that some of the best books have critics turn their noses up at them because they are truly inspiring and uplifting -- unlike Plainsong, where at the end of the book sad people are still sad, they've just realized that it's better to have a group of friends with whom to share your life. ""..exalt the reader"" it says on the cover. Not this one. Is it a new literary trend not to use quotation marks around spoken lines? Or for authors to repeatedly have characters say ""should of"" instead of ""should have""?"
"Wise and humane: An enjoyable read, ""Plainsong"" compassionately looks at the verities of life - the good and the bad. Haruf write with a realistic, yet kind and graceful, style that ultimately leaves one with hope.Interesting to hear that this will be a Hallmark movie in November. This book isn't sentimental and I hope that will be true of the ""Hall of Fame"" special on CBS. The casting of Aidan Quinn and Rachel Griffiths is promising."
Plainsong Review: Plainsong. The first english book that I actually liked reading through out high school. It draws you in and doesn't let you go until you are finished. Haruf opened my eyes to the real world out there. Before this book I never realized how tough life is for everyone. I give this book four stars. I don't like to read much but I actually liked to pick up this book and read it.
"Madison County Redux: PLAINSONG is just plain sorry! What has happened to the American reader's intellect? I'm not opposed to ""dumbing down"" in order to clarify if an author's writing about, for example, black holes, or the Zero, but PLAINSONG's character portraits and plot lines read like the outline for a movie script, or like a volume in an Introduction-to-Reading series. Fair enough, but not great fare for the average reader. To Haruf, I say Harumph! This book is the Son of Bridges of Madison Crummy -- if you loved that, you'll go bonkers for this!"
"A Delight!: One of the best books I've read this year. I fell TOTALLY in love with the McPheron brothers! From page one, the story and the characters just sweep you away - like a song..."
"Plainsong: As part of a book club, I read this book. The point of my joining the bookclub was to read books I might normally not have picked up on my own, as I am open to reading about new ideas and subjects everyday. A friend of mine and I both read this book and the next time we met , the looks on our faces said it all. WHAT A WASTE OF GOOD PAPER! I see that the book has now been made into a movie and I told my friend such. All she could say is 'NOOOOO!' My favorite part of the book was 'blah blah blahblahblah, BLAH?' Oh, wait that wasn't part of it but the whole book sure READ like that."
"Resonating People: Kent Haruf's ""Plainsong"" is a down to earth, intertwining of lives in small town Colorado. The tone, language, style and content all reflect the simple complexity of relationships and loneliness. We get a glimpse into a world where just being together through the hard times is a more effective coping tool than running. We get to see two little boys start to come of age, a teenage girl whose life seems over give birth surrounded by love and joy, and two old men who find the courage to love. Contrasted with typical modern reality the small town of Holt is a comforting place where each life actually impacts the others. There is no anonymity; each life matters. And as we get to know the characters, their lives matter to us as well. I would definitely recommend this book if you're craving a journey into a simpler place where good and bad are plain as day and life is determined by people rather than day planners."
Plainsong: The book is in OK condition. It has yellow pages making it look older than what it really is. I could have bought another book for $1 more and not yellow -- easier to read.Plainsong
"Heartwarming, old fashioned story: This is a lovely tale of people in a small town who help one another get over bad times. The prose is beautiful. The story will give you faith in your fellow man."
"Felt as though I was right there: This had the same quality as ""Snow Falling on Cedars""--the atmosphere was so much a part of the story. Having lived in a rural area of the country for 13 years, I felt as if I knew each of the characters. It's a love story like nothing I've read before."
"A must read!: I hadn't really expected much of Plainsong on picking it up at the libray - not my usual type of book. However, on starting to read, I was unable to put it down without finishing it. I have to say this is the best novel I have read this year, that from an avid reader!"
"Impressive Mini Series: This is a wonderful movie about an anchient chinese story. The Journey To The West is a book on a scholar that travels to a different world. The movie has great effects and the characters fill the standards of the book. If you love magic and adventure this movie is good. Also if you were interested in movies like: Merlin, 10th kingdom, and Arabian Nights this movie is just what your looking for."
"More Than a Fantasy: While I seriously condsidered turning it off after the first ten minutes because it looked stupid, I'm glad I was patient enough to continue watching. I liked T. Gibson's comedic timing and dry delivery, the exotic Buddhist characters, but most of all I was intrigued by the plot involving Master Wu, the writer censored and oppressed. This storyline has a lot to say about controversies like this in all times in all countries. Once that came up, coupled with the love story between Nick and Kwan, I was riveted."
"a terrific yarn!: a long story, never boring. More fascinating due to the titillating, unfortunate career decision later made by the actress who here plays the goddess Quan Yin."
"damn good shoe: bought these for work and for concerts (mosh pits etc). comfy from day 1, durable, just buy it"
Strawberry Sparkle Cake: This pan worked out fine. My cake came out just right. The packaging was fine and I would reccommend this merchant on this particular item.
"My least favorite Album: I only like 2 tracks of this album, In my opinion is a little boring. If you like the speedy Sonata Arctica, this album is not for you. At least ""Days of Grays"" is a better album"
"Disapointed: Im a big of them. Alot of the songs didnt go anywhere at werent catchy at all. There previous albums all were great. Theres nothing that comes close to The Cage, Full Moon among many others. Im glad i have Ecliptica coming in the mail after hearing this cd."
"Very enjoyable: This is the first book by Forster I've ever read and I enjoyed it a great deal.Forster takes the time to present a world to us while being explicit about what he is leaving out (the ""very poor""). In this book, the lives of the rich, the middle class, and the lower middle class collide. In the first part of the book, the collision is one of ideas and conversation. By the end of the book, it is quite physical and literal. This is the part of the book I enjoyed less, as it felt a bit too much like manufactured drama given the pages that preceded it.The themes of how we should approach the good fortune we inherit (and how we should treat others who have inherited differently) and how we can genuinely connect with other people are more applicable today than ever."
"Half a Good Book: Roger Kahn has shamelessly used the attraction of the great Brooklyn Dodgers to lure people into reading what turns out to be his autobiography/confession/pyscho-therapy session. Instead of concentrating his entire effort on the great Dodger players of the 50's he exposes the reader to his own childhood of overbearing parents, sex-crazed housekeepers and personal issues of inadequacies. The half of the book that concentrated on the players was excellent, but with so much time wasted on his personal life that we as baseball fans have no interest in, it has been turned into a mediocre volume and definitely not for younger readers. If one can sort through the muck of his life story it may have value as a reference book, but otherwise it has very little to offer in the way of entertaining reading."
"Very dissapointing: If you are expecting an insightful potrait of baseball in 1950's Brooklyn look elsewhere. What this book delivers instead is a re-heated version of ""Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man."" The author is so self-absorbed that any baseball lore one may find in the book must be washed down with a large dose of his syrupy personal saga. Along the way Kahn manages to drain all the vitality out of baseball and replace it with warm tapioca pudding."
"Small fit: For a big and tall pant, this is an awful fit. I wear a 44W x 34L, so I was glad to find that Amazon carried Docker's in this size. Saves a trip to the mall. Price seemed good. When I got these pants I was very disappointed. While the fit in the waist and length were tight on, the butt and the thights were sized like a skinny jean a teenage boy might wear. Not at all the fit I was expecting. Very misleading. I have bought the ""signature"" khaki through JC Penney in their stores tons of times so I thought I was getting the same thing with a nice comfortable fit, you know, the things dockers are know for. I was really disappointed that amazon would not reimburse the shipping saying that incorrect fit is not their problem. I told them it was a case of incorrect descriptions, but they didn't care. How the hell did they win for best customer service a couple years ago? I don't see it. Don't buy these unless you a tall fat guy who wants a really tight pair of pants."
"A little short: I chose this rating because the inseam was not 36"". I measured after I noticed they looked a little shorter than usual. A little more attention to detail please. The inseam was 35 1/2"". When you are tall and have difficulty finding pants that 1/2' makes a big difference."
The Best Toy in the World!!!: This is my favorite toy in the whole world. I play with it every day and it sleeps with me and my stuffed animals evry night. Sometimes we pretend we go to the moon together and we go there in the big red car. Other times we go to the rainforest. At night Anthony fights off clowns and wears a ninja suit. This toy has saved my life many times from evil clowns. He is my favorite toy.
"Bad Religion's worst release: I'm a huge Bad Religion fan and love their newer stuff but this is just subpar. I don't have a problem with the slower style of writing...the songs are just plain bad. There's no catchy choruses or anything. Greg's lyrics arn't even that good. I'd only recommend this to die hard BR fans and even they should buy it used.In it's defense there are three decent songs. You've Got A Chance, It's A Long Way To The Promised Land, and Whisper In Time. The rest is filler."
ever band has one bad album: and this is it....this is just real bad....im mean burn it and forget about it bad....
"brilliant and overlooked: This series has lately been dismissed by shallow art history charlatans who relish theory over the connoisseurship of the eye. Clark suffers only from the irresistible urge to tell the truth; some cultures are more exquisite and developed than others, and the artistic record gives evidence to that fact. Beautifully filmed, artfully argued, timeless."
"A really good record: As a fan of Wilco, I've followed the boys back to Uncle Tupelo (I'm currently infatuated with Anodyne) and forward to this one. Very enjoyable, particularly if you like Jeff Tweedy's songs, and really you ought to. ""Fear of Falling"" and ""Lost Love"" are great songs, and ""Please Tell My Brother"" is so beautiful that I got my guitar out immediately to learn it. Not every song is great, but the good ones really stick in your head."
"unplayable flippers = ripoff: I bought this a week ago and have watched 5 movies. The first four all had multiple corrupted zones and the fifth doesn't even load. At all. I am going to have to reboot the machine to get the dvd out. This set has good movies in it, but you won't be able to see them with this box set. Total ripoff. Worst Amazon experience ever."
"Very nice set but.... very hard to find your movie: Very nice set of movies, however in this day and age can they not at least print the movie titles on the disks? I am not talking about the little small center on the disk. I met Mr Eastwood a few times, I do not think he would approve"
"Clint: Great movies. It was a gift and my husband loved it. Howeve, one did not show right, and it is too much of a hassle to do anything about it."
"CC or HOH? Nope!: Great set but no closed caption. No hard of hearing. Oh, they do not understand how big the HOH market is. A hundred million!"
spanish subs?: I need to know if there are spanish subs for all the movies. Also if they are dubbed into spanish. It would be great to know. Thanks. I hope somebody can answer before the deal finish.
"Not Good: I bought two sets of these towels. One of the sets faded immediately upon the first use. The towels have a good feel, but do not dry a person especially well. That alone would have been tolerable, but the fading is a deal killer. Fading occurred while in use, before even washing for the first time.Would recommend you take a pass on these and pay a bit more for nicer towels that will last."
"Very high quality towel: This towel is a very lush, high quality one. The Aloe green color is a beautiful soft green that matches almost any neutral bathroom. It is a very soft towel that stayed true to shape and softness even after being used and washed."
"Where is the speech?????: This home made DVD has everything except what it's suppose to have...The actual ""I have a dream speech""!! It goes right up to the moment MLK is introduced to the podium and then dissolves to him leaving!!! Don't buy unlees you want B-fotage of the event!!"
"Mio P550: Very good GPS, plus fully functional PDA. Short battery life - if you are going to use WIFI or bluetouth its just 20-40 minuties.Bigest advantage of PDA GPS - you can install software from different vendor.I tried to use Skype on this unit (WIFI). Built-in mic has very bad quality and I can't connect and re-direct sound stream to the bluetouth headset."
Very Good GPS for money: I think that this is very functional and well executed device. Once you get used to the software it is accurate and easy to use. Very good car mount which allows for many configurations inside your car.WiFi and Bluetooth both work well and fast.Windows Mobile is not any worse or better then other hand held PC. Messaging and sinchronization work OK and this could be reasonable travel companion rather then laptop. You do need to carry a charger since battery life is short. You get couple hours if you use your energy saving mode.
"Love this book: I have tried about 4 receipes from this book and the hubby and two young children and my self have all been very happy with them and they are reasonable ingredients to obtain, and seem to be a kit with the kids!! Bonus!!!"
"I already have a cookbook: I really bought this book because I have two small girls and I wanted my family to be the family who cooks dinner every night and eats at the dinner table instead of feeding the babies and us eating later. So I thought this would be more of a workbook or something to help me accomplish this. Okay, so I already have cookbooks and I can honestly say I can write and use a grocery list. So this seems to be all this book is. A cookbook with a grocery list. If cookbooks and grocery lists did it for me, I would already be cooking dinner for the family every night."
"Refreshing encounter with a great mind: Dewey's philosophy is hard for some people to get into, or take seriously, because his whole body of concerns and ideas are present behind every sentence-- so, even though his language is plain-spoken, it is ""saturated with meaning,"" to use one of his phrases. So it takes real work, and he doesn't always succeed in keeping the foreground clear, while remembering the background. It's DOING philosophy, rather than merely writing ABOUT it. This book is a great example -- what does philosophy do for us, how does it contribute when it is woven into the other enterprises of life, and what ideas in philosophy stand it the way of its making a living contribution. The book is full of dramatic, and even radical thinking, but in quiet, reflective language that requires relaxed, persistent attention."
"Great experimental fiction: A great book because it makes you realize a story does not have to be told sequentially and thus makes you question the nature of time - a theme central to the book's plot. If you like this you also will probably like Zelazny's ""Doorways in the Sand"" and ""Lord of Light."""
"Great Doll!: AS the previous reviewer said, these are great dolls for boys. It's just nice to FINALLY have more toys for little boys to play with and use their imagination. These dolls are really great for imagination development. Durable too. I'm glad I was able to get one before they're gone!"
YUM: Swine and Roses...what a great song. It must be my favorite TKK song so far. Very great to dance to at a club. The bass is perfect and the vocals are superbly done.
"Amazing little space savers: If you are a gadget junky like me you can understand the frustration of only being able to use 3 or 4 of the outlets in your 6 outlet power strip. It drives me up a wall that all these transformer boxes for your PDAs, laptops, digital cameras, etc. are so big that they cover an unused outlet on your power strip. I had often wondered why the manufacturer couldn't place the transformer higher up the cord (in all honesty I have a couple of gadgets whose manufacturers did do just that).These little guys are great. The cords are about 12"" long and now keep transformers off of the powerstrip. They seem very strong and made of a heavy duty cord. My only grip is the length. For my purposes 4"" - 6"" would have been perfect. This however is extremely minor.I bought two packs of these and I don't know how I have lived without them. I would recommend them to everyone."
"Eat to the Beat for the Millenium!: Don't expect an album of ""Good Boys"" and other dance tracks, as this is more of a ""rock"" record. It rocks as hard as ""Eat to the Beat"" did but has a more updated sound. Just like the latter, it takes a few listens to get hooked, but when you do you are cursed. Favorites are ""Diamond Bridge"", ""The Tingler"", ""Rules for Living"" and ""Last one in the World."" Also, ""Shakedown"" is very cool, critics just dont' get it. Debbie has never claimed to be a great rapper..she's just having lots of fun."
"Blondie's Only Curse is Talented Songwriting: Debbie Harry has always been The Queen of the double-entandra, and she proves it once again with The Curse of Blondie. Every song on this CD is haunting and memorable. No old rehash of Paralell Lines, or Autoamerican. The music is fresh and innovative. The single ""Good Boys"" is a nice dancetrack done as only Blondie can. However, it is not the best track from this rich collection. ""Goldenrod"" contains quite a play on words, and the first track ""Shakedown"" combines raw sexuality with rap as only Ms. Harry can do. On first play, you may wonder if you like this CD. Then the music will replay in your head and you will have to listen again...that's when you realize that this CD will not wear out it's welcome anytime soon."
"Excellent ""Modern Day"" Blondie!!!! An Excellent CD!!!!: There have already been plenty of reviews on this one, so I'll just mention a few things. It contains 14 great songs. I really liked the first one ""Shakedown"", Debbie really gets into this one!!! Other songs I liked include: ""Good Boys"", ""Undone"", ""Background Melody"", ""Majic"", ""End to End"", and ""Hello Joe"". Basically, I liked all the songs, it's great from beginning to end.Some of these songs are featured on the Blondie ""Live by Request"" DVD. These songs are ""Good Boys"", ""Undone"", ""End to End"", and ""Hello Joe"".Overall, this is a great CD containing 14 great songs, and I highly recommend it. Thanks!!!"
"Ehhh...: This video is alright. Eric Roberts is not very believable as a young school aged boy, and his physical acting during the painting and symphony scenes is distracting and overdone. The video has elements not included in the story, perhaps to make Paul seem a more humane character than the cold portyal in print. In the written story, he seems to simply shut out his father and look down on his peers with an aloof disdain. However, the movie shows a boy who tries to please his father; a boy treated cruelly by his classmates. Though nicely filmed and authentic in appearance, the film tries too hard to accomplish what the story did not."
"disapointed: I really Like Mr Liddy and was hoping that this book would give me more of the Liddy Style, but it was full of things that you could get over the internet. I wanted to see more things that one could do to protect ones self, as I thought Mr Liddy could share. The book has many good generic tips. I just wanted to read more things that Mr Liddy and his son could tell us that could be found no where else. I felt the book fell a bit short."
"A Very Funny Document: Vertiginous Falls Descend through Vast Frigid Domains! Vicious Flies Dart! Villainous Felons Destroy Valuable Fortress! Don't vacillate from despair, though! Various friends drop by, Violet fabricates devices, Klaus's vocabulary fathoms dilemmas, and as for Sonny: View Fine Dentition! In fact, the whole valorous family dexterously vanquishes foul designs.So, does the story come out all right in the end? Vexed. Foggy. Doubtful...This volume provides all the lugubrious fun that all the others do. And the words Volunteer Fire Department are spoken out loud, if I recall correctly, for the first time. (Darn. I felt sure that's what VFD was going to stand for - but now they've trotted it out three whole books of unfortunate events from the end, I must have been wrong. But whatever the mysterious answer turns out to be, I know our young heroes will face it with Virtue, Firmness, and Dignity.)"
"Volunteer Fire Department: Here we find ourselves, in a runaway caravan gonig down a slope wery fast. Or at least that's where we'd find Violet and Klaus. Here we are at last. Almost near the end to a very devastating series. only three more to go! in this one we find the children stuck up in a mountain high in the hinterlands. They are deadly close to unlocking VFD's secret, and to finding out if their parents are still alive."
"The Slippery Slide: Just imagine that you are a three-year-old orphan with a fortune in trust funds worth millions of dollars. This would be great, if you weren't captured by an evil man named Count Olaf who has been trying to steal your fortune since your parents died. This is the position that Sunny Baudealire found herself in. The only thing she had going for her was that her siblings Violet and Klaus were close behind trying to save her and their fortune.This book was great! It had non-stop action which made you want to keep turning the pages. Lemony Snicket pretending to be a researcher of the Baudealire orphans gave the book a unique spin. Overall I would give this book a nine out of ten.I would definitely recommend this book. This book is a great read, but would not make any sense if you have not read the first nine books. If you have read the other books, this is a must read."
"More music from heaven . . .: I really doubted that there could be a SW recording that could rival ""Sacred Ground"", but this one does. Politically charged, passionate and thoroughly enjoyable . . . particularly ""Greed""."
"Beautiful Music -- Not Chanting: If you've experienced 'live' chanting, without musical background, this CD will not bring that experience 'back'. I was hoping for male voices, chanting in unison. This CD contains 2 entries, both of the same song. The first version has singing with it, the other is the instrumental only."
"Poorly Written: Sounds like a man who desperately needs to be accepted by those around him, who have far surpassed him in every way. This is a man who with all his things, his parties, his screenings, his speeches, has created very little. A sad character. The book is self-serving for his own library. It's something to show friends. Just another piece in the plastic armor. A man who if credit must be given probably is an overachiever. But has he personally ever put himself on the line for a film like Wendy Finerman did for Forrest Gump? From this book this guy sounds like he truly cares about himself. Throwing fundraisers so people say what a great guy he is. Nobody will think that after reading this book. Not worth the time. Read ""You'll Never Eat Lunch in this Town Again"" instead."
"Fascinating Take on the Film Industry - 1970's and Beyond: A fascinating take on the film industry from both an agent's/producer's point of view. A number of the films he's had a direct handle in are amongst my all time favorite list and it's interesting to read backstage stories about the process, how these films came to be and how sometimes it's merely the luck of the draw.Kudos to Mr. Michael Medavoy for an extremely well written book as well as a long and distinguished career.His book is enjoyable from start to finish."
"Un-realized potential: Being a person who found Garland's well-reviewed THE BEACH to be nothing more than a re-hashing of LORD OF THE FLIES, I can't say that I was surprised with this novel. Garland's short-lived exploration of the concept of the tesseract reveals nothing more than the fact that he has fooled himself into thinking that he is the next Joyce, who explored similar ideas with his notions of parallax and metempsychosis. Some of the reviews exhibited on this page reveal that he has fooled a few others as well. Garland's lack of interest in his own characters is revealed dually in this novel, by the brief treatment that each character receives and by the narrative's oversight of the most sympathetic character, the deformed fisherman. The most disappointing part of this novel is Garland's loss of his unique descriptive style. There are no memorable phrases here to rival those such as a ""tie-dye sunset"" which appear in THE BEACH. Garland is a poor man's David Foster Wallace."
"DIDN'T FIT THE LAWN TRACTOR: I had used this kit on my Huskie 38 inch Lawn tractor. It fit perfectly. My friend's dad just bought a Huskie 42 inch. Both models are made by MTD. WE FIGURED THAT THIS KIT SHOULD ALSO FIT THE 42 INCH, PER THE DESCRIPTION. This kit is NOT for the 42 inch tractor. It isn't even close. Speaking to the manufacturer, we found out that the model 42 inch we have, requires a different kit. So just be aware..."
"Ghosts, guilt, and graveyards: Ah, yes. Hailed by many as Shakespeare's Magnum Opus (is that right?), this is certainly one of his most significant dramatic works. Hamlet is an atmosperic story of internalization - of feelings (guilt, love, hatred), of people, thoughts, and actions. Marked by indecision and a strong sense of self-pity and self-consciousness, Hamlet makes the slow transition from fear to determination in his quest to avenge his father's death. Oedipal complex, supernatural powers, royal incest, revenge - these are all explored in the play. Several famous questions are posed and thoughts explored - of existence, suicide, meaning, value. Hamlet is just packed with philosophy, psychology, and humanity. A must-read in which you will find many of the most famous soliloquies in all of Shakespeare. Thrown in Yorick's skull, poor Ophelia, good Horatio, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, you've got yourself one awesome play."
"Hamlet! More like Spamlet!: I don't know what Willy Shakespeare was thinking when he wrote this one play tragedy, but I thought this sure was boring! Hamlet does too much talking and not enough stuff. He needs to shape up and show them who's boss. Maybe Shakespeare fans of Hamlet should take a rest on the book tragedy! Ha ha!"
"Oh baby are you meant for me?!!!!: I absolutely am on fire about this CD cuz it's hot!!!! The hi-hat repetition is so much fun that I can't contain myself!!! Plus who can beat a name that's so much fun to say as, ""Thrill Kill, Thrill Kill, Thrill Kill, K-k-k-k-Kult!!!"" Try it and continue to ride the mindway!!!!"
Dialogues with God: Mrs. Roberts has authored several books and I have read them all. Their content comes from a lady with a very deep and personal relationship with God. Her words are very inspiring and leads to a closer walk with the Lord. They are of much help when seeking guidance as we walk daily seeking a new and fresher walk with the Lord. I would give each of them a five star rating.I have spoken personally with Mrs. Roberts and she is a very gracious lady.Margaret C. Duran/Author of Life In Satan's Grip and others.
"Avoid Dark Fields: I love horror films and will watch anything once, even if it scores a low rating. I was at a store where movies where 4 for 20 and I kept on looking at this movie. The cover is cool but then again every horror film has a cool cover to suck viewers in. Dark Fields sucks like everyone else has claimed nothing worth viewing it again. Matter of fact, I turned it off when the action picked up because I was damn bored. Avoid this movie, you'll be happy you did."
"A TOTAL WASTE.: A CAR OF 5 RUNS OUT OF GAS.THE DRIVER GOES TO AN OLD FARMHOUSE FOR HELP.NOBODY ANSWERS.WHEN HE DOESN'T COME BACK-THE OTHERS GO LOOKING FOR HIM.THEY CAN'T FIND HIM.ONE COUPLE GO INTO A BARN TO LOOK FOR HIM.ALL OF A SUDDEN-LIGHTS COME ON.ZACK THINKS ITS HIS FRIENDS PLAYING A JOKE ON THEM-SO HE DARED THEM TO START THE ENGINE.HE HAD HIS HAND IN A MOTOR.THE ENGINE STARTS-HE LOST HIS HAND.HE DIED.LATER-DREW GOT A RAILROAD PEG STUCK IN HIS HEART-HE DIED.SO NOW THE GIRLS ARE RUNNING ALL AROUND TRYING TO FIND WEAPONS TO KILL THE KILLER.THERE WAS NO SUSPENSE,EXCITEMENT,OR ANY EMOTION.YOU KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.IT'S VERY BORING."
"send this film and motorhome massacre to Pluto one way ticket: my god, what a waste of time. this movie along with Motor Home Massacre have such cool covers that one gets really cheated! At least M.H.M. had some nude to watch,but still is crap, just as this movie is. Avoid it!!!"
"A worthy sequel: I loved Interview with the Vampire so I went out and got this book. I absolutly loved it. I thought Louis and Lestat were the most interesting characters in the first book so I was dying to read more about Lestat. In this book, you get a different picture of Lestat. You learn what he was like before he became a vampire, how he became one, and his adventures afterword. There is unfortunatly not much on his life with Louis and Claudia, but it's still a wonderful book. The ending is marvelous!"
"The best in the series.: This was the best book in the ""vampire"" series. It was well thought out and well written. It's slow at parts, but quickly picks up. It's very good."
"WHY ALL THE SADNESS?: I loved and still do the first book ""Iterview with the vampire."" And my hopes were so high for this one....but I didn't want all the sadness, the tears..we had enough of that with Louis...and the homosexuality amongst the vampires....Why not put at least ONE female into the heart of at least ONE vampire...not a mother, or sister, but a woman he would lust for. I'm sorry, but I wouldn't mind a little passion there between a woman and a vampire.....Sorry Ann, but you've written about men lusting for each other enough for a lifetime....."
hands down the best character in contemporary literature: This most wonderful of characters is well defined and excellent in his description. Anne Rice has a real talent for drawing in the reader with not only vivid description but the human and emotional aspects. In this book we learn of Lestat's rich past and mischievous present tales. A complicated character but certainly one that everyone loves to hate. Probably because he represents humanity in all its wonderful and dread realities. A must read for anyone.
Spare yourself!: I LOVE to read everything and anything and I have this weird thing about finishing books no matter how bad they are. Well in this case I couldn't even finsish no matter how hard I tried (and at that point I just wanted to finish to get it over with).I read Interview with the Vampire and I struggled with it. I gave it the benefit of the doubt since I saw the movie first and figured that is probably why I didn't like it. So I decided to give Lestat a chance and I am sorry I ever did. I found this book to be very boring. It moved at a very slow pace and I gave up waiting for it to get good. I'm sure how so many people can love this book and consider it a great piece of literature?! I definitely will not be reading any more of Anne Rice's books.
"People! Anne Rice is not THAT great: I made the mistake of reading the reviews on all on Anne Rice before reading any of her work. From readin the reviews, I came to the conlusionsthat either you love Anne Rice or you hate her. I started thinking that i belonged int the former group, but now I think that I belong in the latter. It was a major disapointment to read The Vampire Lestat which drones on and on but, for the most part, has no point. I have heard the argument ""Oh well, you obviously don't like books that are interllectual and philosophical."" The point is that I DO like those kinds of books, but not when they have no point and are a good cure fo insomnia."
"Wisdom Of The Mystic Masters: I read this book twentyfive years ago, and I began to seriously change my life. Unfortunately I loaned the book to a friend and could never get it back. I soon thereafter made contact with the Rosicrucians. The last twentyfive years has been a journey, and although I had only studied earnestly with the Rosicrucians for six months or so, everything that they taught me has been validated through observation and experience. I mourned the loss of this book for twentyfive years, and just happened across it here in Amazon. I am now reading it again, and I am amazed at how much I have progressed....and how much more there is to do. My youngest daughter and my first two of more to come grandchildren are blessings that I would never have been granted had I not read this book and found my way to the Rosicrucians. I am so happy to have found this book again."
"Not fun George here, buy Bo instead: George needs more work. He doesn't sing his songs so well and they all sound the same.Jumpy fun George is gone. Too bad but he was nice guy, maybe next time!Save your money and buy Bo Bice's new AWESOME, AMAZING, album called The Real Thing! Bo will show you how it's done! Bo's the REAL DEAL folks! Bo blows all the other Idols who ever went on the show out of the water, makes them look real bad"
Thierry Mugler Angel body lotion: This purchase was quickly and safely shipped and arrived in great shape. The lotion is fresh (unlike some I have received) and I highly recommend this seller. Thanks for your prompt shipping and attention to detail.
"Quality of Angel body lotion has declined: Angel body lotion used to be so creamy and dreamy when it was in the squeeze bottle.Years ago, one small dab would leave an enchanting scent that would only go away when washed off.In the pump bottle, it is a watered down, weakened fragrance.And it seems to get worse every time I order.Nothing against the vendor; the shipment arrived super fast and nothing was damaged.But the texture of the Angel lotion is thin and the scent is disappointingly weak -- barely there even if I lather it on.The vendors show the picture of the squeeze bottle, but 4 out my last 5 orders came with the pump bottle instead of the squeeze bottle pictured."
"DID NOT RECEIVE THE PRODUCT THAT I ORDERED: I DID NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCT THAT I HAD ORDERED, I HAD ORDERED ""ANGEL--CELESTIAL BODY LOTION"" WHICH WAS THE PRODUCT THAT WAS SHOWN ON LINE, WHAT I RECEIVED WAS ""ANGEL PERFUMING BODY LOTION"" NOT AT ALL WHAT I WANTED--SO I GAVE IT TO MY FRIEND, HAD TO ORDER FROM ANOTHER SITE TO GET THE CORRECT ORDER. VERY VERY DISAPOINTED--THE PRODUCT SHOWN WAS NOT THE PRODUCT SENT.IN THE FUTURE I WILL ORDER FROM THE OTHER SITE, PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOUR SENDER SENDS OUT THE PRODUCT THAT IS ADVERTISED, AS THESE TWO PRODUCT ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER, MADE BY THE SAME COMPANY, THIERRY MUGLER,,,BUT NOT THE SAME PRODUCT."
"This Is NOT The Supremes: Please do not think this is The Supremes, it is 3 women who are not the Supremes.... I can't believe they are allowed to try to fool us into thinking the are the real thing....DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY"
"Good toy: This book is so easy to transport-- provides a nice distraction for baby when we're on the go. Now that she's a little older, we focus on the sounds for the animals pictures, and my daughter loves the rattle and squeaker in the toy."
Brilliant: Brilliant brilliant brilliant. I just wished it was longer. It's like Black Books crossed with Jane Eyre. Gothic and hilarious.
"Truly Beautiful...: What can I say about this CD that hasn't already been said? Not much, except that I couldn't have picked a better way to be introduced to island/world music! Every song on this CD, from the incredible ""For You"" to the wonderful rendition of ""Misirlou"", is crafted with such apparant love and passion, that you can't help but feel every emotion that this music tries to convey."
"You NEED this book!: This book belongs in every woman's library. It is entertaining and easy to read, but makes finances and saving for retirement easy. Honest, even if you ""aren't good at math."""
"Emeril disappointed me.: I purchased the Emeril Cast Iron 10"" square grill pan based on recommendations on Amazon. I found that the pan did not live up to myexpectations at all. I wanted to use it for smaller amounts of meat for my husband and myself without firing up the gas grill. I found that even using my gas stove on high, I could not get the pan hot enough to achieve grill marks without overcooking the meat. Despite the fact that it is advertised as preseasoned, I found that hamburgers stuck to it badly, and it was hard to clean without using soap. I plan to put it in the next garage sale. Not worth the space to store it."
"A vivid tale of one girl's difficult climb to her mom's past: How far shoulr one gilr go to reveal the truth of her mother's unknown and horrific past? What exactly does a daughter do when she is only a short bus ride away from her dead mother's own home-town? Read this riviting story of one young girl, and one big secret!!!"
"Incomplete Effort: The performers in this opera are excellent, as well as the orchestra. The problem lies in the fact that the ""recitativi"" are missing. As a result, you are not actually listening to the opera, but rather a series of highlights from the opera. It is very difficult to follow the opera as it develops, since the recitativi provide the opportunity to develop the plot line.If you are interested in hearing highlights from this opera, then you will be pleased with this CD and booklet. However, if you would like to listen to the complete opera as composed by Mozart, please look elsewhere."
"Shameful..: Stop the myth and the heroics...A bunch of illegal aliens, rapacious and fighting for their right to have slaves.Stop adorning theft and racism."
"Very cute!: I have three of this bear; green, pink and yellow. All are pastel colors and I love them because they remind me of spring. They're soft, which I really like. I have several different Beanie Babies bears, but these are definitely the softest."
"Solid Performing Camera Case: This is a great purchase to match the DSC-T30 Camera. It screws in the tripod mount, looks great and protects the camera well."
"Don't take a chance!!: If you make the mistake of buying this game and want to return it...good luck! The Factory Depot told me it's ""non re-retunable."" Thank goodness for Amazon's awesome customer service. They covered it under their A to Z Guarantee policy."
Did not live up to expectations.: Have used this product for several weeks and have seen absolutely no difference. Definitely will not purchase again. On the other hand they sent me a sample of Truth Revealed Super Creme which has been phenomenal! Within about two weeks of using it I began receiving all sorts of compliments in regards to how great my skin looks (I am 50). I am not kidding - my skin looks youthful and glowing. Ordered more immediately. Thanks for the sample Ole!
"Poor Quality: These are SMALL!!!! The feathers get ink on your palms and back, but what do you expect for 15 bucks."
"hard to wear: The quality of the feathers are good. The wings look great. But what's up with the super long arm straps? Instead of sitting on my shoulder blades like they do on the model on the packaging, they sag on my back because they are way too long.If I am wearing it incorrectly, which I highly doubt because I've wore other wings before and it seems like a simple enough concept, at least there should be a pamphlet with directions. A product like this should be easy to wear. I don't get why the manufacturer constructed the arm straps this way."
"What's better than Monster??: the cables are built with high standards, i am happy to have them conected to all my equipment!!"
The best: this judy garland box set is wounderfull it has songs i never heard before and i have over 20cds not includig the ones in my boxed sets. if anyone out there loves judy garland or has never heard her give it a try i like it maybe you will? So buy a cd that dosen't have so many songs or just sample some songs right here in amazon.com.
Aw man!: So much promise but so little effort! This really could have been done well but wasn't. My love for Adam West and Burt Ward were the only reasons I got this. Frank Gorshin's Riddler was a delight to see again as well!
love it!!!!: love it.. it was just what i want it .the pic was as it look . i will be ordering again..
Killed my Koi: Once I installed the filter a film of oil or grease seeped into my pond (I presume sealant for the lid). All of my koi died within 24 hours.
"Glad to have Jeff back: I have been a fan of Jeff Healey since the 80's. I am pleased that his ""new"" venture into Jazz and Blues finally got an album available in the US. Jeff is great on the trumpet, his guitar (as always) is fantastic, and his vocals are enjoyable. While I am not a fan of the trombone the fiddler with the Jazz Wizards was a surprise and is a lot of fun. If you are a Jeff Healey fan and like Jazz and Blues I would recommend adding this to your collection."
"They're still going strong!: It's been a few years now since buying this set and they still work like the day we got them! The coating is still perfect, none of the handles are falling off, the lids are still perfect after being dropped on several occasions. For the money, this is a great starter set for both those new to cooking and those who love to cook but need a set that's more economical! You can't go wrong with buying this set!"
Like White Bread: I love Sesame seeds and Whole Grain Rye. This is however all Wheat flour and tastes like white bread. It is also a smaller 7 oz instead of 9.8 oz.Less of an inferior product. Notice it is manufactured in Germany and not Sweden.
It's a Snap N Go--Great!: You will love this item because1. Small Car space--folds into the trunk of my camry2. Lightweight--for those w/weak arms3. Easy to maneuver.But be sure to download the manual from the maker's website beforehand to check which models go with this. Perfect since I got a handme down infant carrier that worked from a friend. A shame I can't continue with this same model. Wish the basket below held more than 5 lbs.Car Seat expert also told me you really don't need to go with those heavy transportation systems. A snap n go and umbrella stroller is fine if you're cost conscious and heft conscious depending on your needs. Good luck.
"Great for airline travel: I purchased this carrier to use with my Peg Perego infant carseat when we took our first flight after the baby was born. I use the bugaboo frog system primarily, however did not wish to have the bugaboo damaged when I checked it at the gate (it is an expensive system). So, I checked the bugaboo in its padded travel case (accessory) as luggage, and used the Snap n Go to get us through the airport. It was a breeze to set up and take down, and the luggage handlers at the gate had it ready for me as we exited the plane. I would highly recommend purchasing this system if you have a bugaboo (or any other expensive or cumbersone travel system), and use it for airplane travel. The next time I travel, I may leave the bugaboo home."
"Great first stroller: We live in the city and loved the easy fold, big basket, one handed steering option, parent tray and it's light weight. Most babies will fall asleep in their car seat, so its's easy to keep them in their seat and drop them into this carrier and keep them in the car seat. This carrier is less bulky, less expensive than a travel system. We live in the city and it handled well. Though the wheels are plastic and it's not built as robust as a primary stroller, it's a great first stroller option. We are now buying our primary stroller and are happy that we weren't locked into a travel system. Now we can buy the stroller tha best suits our changing needs and we've saved money."
"Great stroller frame, bad cup holder: This stroller frame is a great product. It is very easy to unfold and fold with one hand. It handles very smoothly on bumps and brick paths. The one negative is the cup holders are too shallow. I had a hot cider that spilled on the baby's blanket thank god, and not her skin. So beware of putting any drink without a secure cap in the cup holder."
"Bloody,Brutal but the best!: From the moment the book begins,with the reference to Hickey Dewey of Detroit who called his shirt a shoit and Personville Poisonville to the last words in the last chapter, this is probably the best book in ANY genre of writing ive read. Even the chapter names are great. Theres enough gore in it for the blood thirstiest reader and enough class for professors of English literature. Read this and any current action novel will read like a Mills & Boon romance!"
"Get this book at Amazon.co.uk instead!: The book offered on the US Amazon uses volume instead of weight. This is a very inaccurate way of baking. Things will come out too dry or too soggy because a cup of flour can be too densely packed or too fluffy. Weighing will always be more consistent, so get baking books from the UK and buy yourself a decent inexpensive digital scale."
"Got bread?: Lay-flat binding for the definitive book on bread, which can be made either in a bread machine or by hand. Gluten, wheat and yeast-free breads and recipes for those on restricted diets pack a book filled with color photos of finished products."
"Lovely Little Christmas Cookbook: I purchased this book for my sister-in-law, and she loves it. When I gave it to her, she immediately identified several recipes that she wanted to try. I gave it to her for Thanksgiving so that she would have plenty of time to bake for Christmas. It's a very quaint little book, with a lot of recipes. All of the pictures are quaint illustrations. Each recipe has detailed instructions. I can't wait to see what my sister-in-law comes up with--she's a real baker, so I know she will enjoy the traditional recipes in this sweet little cookbook."
"Intrigue In the Gold Country: Matt Bourdoul joined a wagon train because the beautiful Jacquine Coyle and her family would be traveling on it. He knows there is something wrong because they are going to the gold country. Matt feels the danger and he must find out the plans of this wagon train before it is too late. Louis L'Amour is very descriptive of the setting and his characters. He paints a vivid story of danger, intrigue, and adventure. This is one of his best books. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
"Westward the Tide, L'Amour: Very good reading. All of Louis L'Amour books make for good reading. It's a western murder mystery, well written. Could not put the book down. Intend to order more of L'Amour's books. I recommend this book to everyone."
"Over-rated: This game is a puzzle game. I personally feel that the reviews are too over-rated for what it's worth. It's kind of like Bejeweled except you can only line up blocks vertically, and not horizontally, which kind of bothers me. There's not really a storyline ... it's not incredibly fun, but will probably last you a fairly good ten minutes of game play. It's really the effects when you line up the same colored blocks and the sounds and graphics that give you that ""high"" of the game."
"Love it, very applicable: I loved this book! I found it to be an easy read and very applicable to my life as both a mother of two small children and also an elementary school counselor. I have recommended it to friends and also to parents of students I work with."
"their beauty astounds: the purity of peter, paul and mary's voices is beyond words. their harmonies, clarity and conviction would only be diminished by words. this is a must have piece of work in anyones collection."
"Very Disappointed: The music and songs are great except on every song, the recording stops before the song (and/or music is finished) and after paying almost $19.00, I am not very satisfied with the recording."
"Last of our set: We were very please to get the first book of the set,""Cape Lite"" by Thomas Kinkade.It was hard to find and it was in good condition and at good price.Thank you for your fast dilivery."
Leak problem: The first day i inflated to see if it worked and like in 5 minutes of inflating i noticed that it would lose air. This Air Bed Sucks it Doesnt WORK!!
Pleasantly surprised: We got this because it was the cheapest double high queen inflatable we could find with decent reviews. The documentation states it's for indoor use only but we actually took this camping which worked fine. While plenty thick and durable I'd say it does seem slightly more fragile than ones made for the outdoors. If you're going to take this same route you'll need to have a way to provide AC power to it. In our case we just used an inverter connected to the car and a long extension cord.
"VERY NICE: ERER IN MY MIND I HOLD THE SPECIAL ROUTE FAREAWAY. IN MY TV IN MY CHILD I CAN SEE THE SO SPECIAL ROUTE 66. NOW, I CAN'T SEE MY HEROS AGAIN(MARTIN MILLER& GEORGE MAHARIS BUT, I CAN LISTENTHE THEME ``ROUTE 66''"
TOPS!: This is one of the most wonderful little books that I have ever read! I give it a high recommendation!
"Weak story, even for chic lit.: I am all for an easy read now and again, something to take me away from the grind of the day to day, but ""Some Like it Haute"" was just lame. This commentary may seem harsh but I really did try to like to book and I made myself finish it. However, from Alex's whining about her mistakes in her predetermined outfit organization, to the fact that Paris is teeming with people from Texas, I overdosed in cheesiness. The plot thins more so when Alex hears of her love interests ""big secret"", bizarro at best.All I can honestly say is that anyone who is interested in fashion and designers has the same amount of knowledge as Alex, who sadly has a career in writing about it. So many other good options out there for summer reads, bypass this one."
ahhh!!!: i hated this movie! me and my friend couldnt finish watching it. i thought it was bad. i loved the original. this 1 was too weird. it had a couple good parts but no that many. the oompa loopa songs were not the same. oompa loopmas were not the same. the were not orange with green hair. wat was up with that!! i def would not suggest this to any of my friends or any lovers of the original!
"Painful, Creepy, and Awful: I love Johnny Depp but the creepy Michael Jackson voice ruined this from minute one. Tim Burton must have read a different book than the rest of us. The tortured flashbacks of what made Willy Wonka spoiled what is a story about the deserving getting a break. I would resell it but why would anyone want it."
"Gene Wilder continues to be the Candy Man: Seeing a re-make come out of the absolute classic that defined such a piece of my pre-pubescent youth gave me plenty of doubt that Mr. Depp could pull off anything like the original. Yes, it has special effects, and some quite dandy music, but Johnny Depp does not unseat Gene Wilder; heavens no. The Roald Dahl story is a great one; I think I now need to read the book. It kept me aware of just when this thing might end. I liked the kids better in the original; Charlie is a pretty bland player, and Grandpa Joe in this one comes nowhere close to the great Jack Albertson. Call me old fashioned, call me what you will, but I'll rate the original almost a whole star higher. Make this one 3.9 stars."
"Johnny Depp at his best: I love this movie...Johnny Depp is always good at what he does...I personally think he's great in this movie. I would have preferred if they had a ""making of"" in the special features section, but whatever...I learned how to dance like an Oompa Loompa..."
"No joy, no fun: In general, I enjoy classic movies and I also generally hate remakes. Unfortunately, this is no exception.There is very little magic in this movie as there was in the original. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willie Wonka is very different than Gene Wilder's. It is dark and mysterious, sometimes he comes off as downright cruel. The entire movie seems rushed and forced, and the unneeded sub-plots don't help. Also, the oompa-loompas did not impress me.In short, this movie is strange, and very different from the original. Stick to the classic version that we all know and love."
"Burton and Dahl are quite compatible: The Bottom Line:This fusion of two subtly-sadistic auteurs in director Tim Burton and children's novelist Roald Dahl makes for a much better film than I expected when I saw the trailers back in 2005; I don't think it's as good as Gene Wilder's version, but it hits enough different notes that it can be treated as a separate film rather than a remake, and a good film at that.3/4"
"Outstanding flick!: Johnny Depp is perfect as the ""eccentric"" candy man. Deep Roy and the rest of the cast are terrific too! And the music and CGI are perfect. What a fun, relaxing experience. Willy Wonka was always a childhood favorite, but Charlie and the Chocolate Factory totally outdoes ""WW"". You'll be in for a treat!"
"a poooor excuse for a remake...or simply ANY movie!!!: i originally thought that bc tim burton directed this mooovie...that i world be a great one, considering his genius in the Nightmare Before Christmas...however..this was a MAJOR flop.true disappointment.i wanted to leave in the middle of it but thought 'hey i'll give it a chance, it isss tim burton'well..@ the end of the movie, i felt like a...loser, major.ompa luuumpas my foooooot. it was just one guy who played all the oopma lumpas! what a joke!!!horrible acting. & even though it has socalled special effects, the movie has nooo substance.i want my money back.lolcomes to showww that even socallled geniuuuses make mistakes...and in this case..it was a MAJOR one.tsk tsk.why burton & depp?? whyyyy???the original isss theeee original & theee classic!whyyy burton??sorry gene...they didn't mean to.~:}"
"Progress is not always good: Tim Burton, Johnny Depp - is this why people are agog about this poor remake? Reminds me of the Emporer's New Clothes.. The 1971 musical was uplifting, entertaining, and fun. The new version, plastic and boring. Tim Burton and crew managed to transform fabulous characters into characterless fools. A shame."
"Can never beat the original: Though Tim Burton is a great director of magical movies and Johnny Depp is a terrific actor you cant beat an all time classic at all. the original will always be better because it was great, a remake would be pointless. But I haven't seen it so it could be good but not like the original."
"strange and creepy: i found this movie to be nothing what i expected. obviously hoping that it'd be a fun, updated wacky (Burtonish?) version of the original... I instead came upon a strange, unfunny retelling of our beloved first film. and please don't misunderstand... i absolutely love Tim Burton and his films, and am one of Johnny Depp's biggest fans... yet i found Depp's performance awkward, and the film itself not warm, endearing or funny.and what was with the single computer-cloned oompa loompa? and the overly serious child contestants? in the original they may have been brats, but at least they were funny. everything has such a serious, somber overtone here...i guess it's worth a look, maybe a rental, but overall for me, this was a real disappointment. please go find Gene Wilder instead. that's your true Wonka story."
"I wanted to not like it, but...: This movie was better than the original (not to take any credit away from Gene Wilder because he was amazing in the first one). I have to say I understand the story a lot better this time around. The first movie had several confusing parts that were explained better in this version, and the story fits better with Tim Burton's warped view as director (as the story is warped in itself). The only criticism, which I am not alone in, is the Oompa Loompas, who were really annoying in this version. Although the songs were very clever, I could have done without them-a cross between rap and Saturday Night Fever. Johnny Depp does a great job as the creepy chocolate factory owner. Charlie is less annoying in this version than in the last. I wanted to dislike this movie because it was a remake, but I really liked it and would recommend it highly."
"Very bad movie!: I only give this 2 stars because of the special effects and I am a easy going guy. But this movie sucked. Depp is portrayed as an idiot, and the overall acting in this one is a joke. Charlie's acting is at best 3 stars and the music sucked. Very bad film and a huge insult to Gene Wilder!"
Depp Looks like a girl.: I HATED THIS MOVIE IT DID NOT STICK TO THE PLOT A AND JOHNNY DEPP LOOKS LIKE A GIRL.
"More like the Book: More true to form than the original version that starred Gene Wilder, Tim Burton's version gives us scenes that tbey were unable to do before. Such as the squirrils.A much more darker look at Willie Wonka though protrayed well by Johnny Depp, I didn't like it nearly as much. The first one was fun, this one seemed more along the lines of being disturbing. Aside from that minor detail, it was entertaining.In one scene when the Oompa Loompas, who are very disturbingly identical, begin what Willie Wonka calls a 'spontaneous musical number' one of the guests comments that it seems a bit too 'planned' to be spontaneous. Subtle humor like that is what kept me going.The whole time with his dad who was played by Christopher Lee, a giant in the pulp horror of the sixties and seventies, I felt didn't add much to the wonder of the movie. Rather, it gave more of an odd feel to it.Overall, I liked it. NOt as much as the original, but I did like it."
"couldnt sit through it: absolutely awful! I am a huge Johnny Depp fan, but this movie was so bad i don't have a large enough vocabulary to properly express it. I wanted to turn this movie off 30 minutes in, but my friends kept saying it will get better; eventually after another 20 minutes or so they gave up too(thank god)."
It may have been good...: I dont know because I fell asleep 20 minutes into it. What a boring scrum-diddly-DUD. I'll take the original with all its flaws. At least it kept me awake and wasnt a shallow reminder of a time when substance was more important than style.
"THIS ISN""T A REMAKE OF THE GENE WILDER MOVIE! IT'S ACTUALLY A CLOSER ADAPTION OF THE ROALD DAHL BOOK!: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a good movie and Johnny Depp is superb as Willy Wonka!I have been reading reviews by numbskulls saying that they should never had made this movie and that it was a disgrace to remake a classic 70's movie like Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory well FYI: This is not a remake of the Gene Wilder movie it is actually a much more closer adaptation of the book by Roald Dahl so anyone saying that this movie should never have been made and that it was wrong to make a different movie than the one that starred Gene Wilder well they really should pick up a book once in a while because than they would see that there was a book that came before the Gene Wilder movie and that this Johnny Depp version is closer to that book!"
"Lame and disturbing: This was a really creepy rendition of a great classic movie. Even thought the special-effects are many times better, this version of the story has lost all of the charm. Lame and disturbing. The original was much better.Not recommended."
"Surprisingly Decent: I had expected to absolutely hate this film going in as I love the original and was surprised to find I didn't. Definitely darker in some ways than Gene Wilder's version which I think is why I am able to disentangle the two in my head. Biggest downside to the film was all of the Wonka ""back story"" - totally unnecessary in my opinion and bogged the film down a bit."
"This book sucks I want to leave negative five stars - *****: If you are interested in Huna do not buy this book. It is sad that books like this are written. If you want attention, denounce something that is good. How many people will read this piece of garbage before Max's books or other books on Huna and then not read anything more on Huna at all? What a shame. I have lived in Hawaii most of my life. I have read all of MFL's books as well as many others, and it turns out that a Wal-Mart Ouija board and an airhead can destroy a lifetime of research. The sad part is people who don't know anything about huna will believe her.I for one will never read another of Ms. Kaehr's books. How could I ever believe anything she says?Shame on you Ms. Kaehr!"
"Don't miss this one!: A must have album! Nothing in the world can bring tears to my eyes like the voice of the young Mary Travers as in 500 miles and There is a Ship. I was hoping that when the album was re-mixed that they would lower the volume of the applause after each song, but alas, they didn't. Even with the loud applause, the album is a hit and should be a part of everybodys collection."
"GREAT BOOK FOR SPORTS FANS BY:KELSEY K: Honus and Me is a great book. It's about this little boy named Joe. He loves to collect baseball cards. One day he bought a pack of cards and found a one-of-a-kind Honus Wagner card, What he didn't know was that the card had a special power, ( You need to read the book to find out)My favorite character was Joe. He was a good kid who loved baseball. I like him a lot because I am a big sports fan also.My favorite part of the book was when Joe played in the major league game. He got to experience something that no other kid has done before.I would encourage SPORTS FANS to read this book. Even if you aren't a big sports fan I still think you would really enjoy this book."
"A sports lovers adventure: A Sports Lovers Fantasy!!!!!Honus and Me byDan GutmanThis is a book about a kid who loves sports.In this book he finds thathe has a magical he can go back in time and visit famous baseball players from that time.A exciting part in this book is when Hounus is playing in the world series.((As honus trooted in from his shortstop position at the end of the inning, he looked straight at me and patted his right shoulderwith his left hand.)) (( The signal.)) You will have to read the book to see what is going to happen.I think probally a boy who likes sports books would like this story.This book has fantasy,history, and many other subjects.It is a great mystery and pepole who like old baseball history would ike this book to.I would give this book a 4 out of 5. It is a short bookso if you need to do a book project it is very easy to read and a very fun book to read.This is my favorite book of all time and I would recomnd this book."
Great album: One of my favorite Van Morrison albums. My wife wrote on the wrong side and finally replaced. Gotta have album
"One of the most fascinating books ever written?: I'm not a legal professional, in fact, I have never been inside a courtroom, and I blythely ignore all jury summonses, if truth be known. However, this is an utterly fascinating book, which actually has practical applications in everyday life. Frankly, I suspect just about everyone is bending the truth (paranoid? perhaps...realistic? I do think so!). The techniques in the book ""do"" help, in handling interpersonal relationships. I reread this book regularly...what better a recommendation can one give it?"
"Lots of pages with little to offer: I read this book after reading McElhaney's Trial Notebook. After reading the first book this one read so slowly, with so much wordage that I found it impossible to read. Not worth the money or the time."
"Cut from Now It Can Be Told, Total Devo, & Smooth Noodle Map: If you have Total Devo, Smooth Noodle Maps, and Now it Can be Told, you have this album and more. The sound quality is mediocre and the cuts from the live album are ragged. There is nothing new, and absolutely no liner notes."
"there is nothing ""logical"" about religion: I am not a hater of Islam, per se, but the previous reviewer has obviously never taken a course in logic. Mawdudi's writing is extremely repetitive, as are all religious texts. Mawdudi believes Islam is the ""natural religion"" that everything follows even if it doesn't call itself Muslim, because according to Mawdudi, Islam is submitting oneself to the order of the universe, and the universe is supremely ordered and perfect. Hey Mawdudi, guess what, the universe is a hell-hole. Where are you living, dude?"
"Good CD, don't be discouraged by the practice tests: Even after reading several reviews that warned the Kaplan practice test scores were lower than the actual GMAT scores, I worried about the results. Then, I took the second Official GMAT practice test and scored 100 points higher. When I took the actual GMAT, I scored even a bit higher than that.The CD was silly but helpful, and the more difficult problems forced me to think and work more quickly. I wish I had started with this instead of Barron's!"
"Kindle edition no-nos: The Kindle edition, as of 8-21-2011, has no table of contents, which it desperately needs, and horrible formatting. The html version at Project Gutenberg is better than this one. Hopefully some day these will all be fixed. It really sucks having to click though page after pager after page just to find the story you're looking for, when simply clicking it in the index would bring you there in no time.It's free. Download it and check it out for yourself.*edit*Someone in another color book review mentioned that there is a collection of all of these that is much better anyways. Check it out."
solid gaiters: I bought these for my kili climb...they are well made and did what they are supposed to do. The only annoyance is that they trap moisture...not sure if there are gaiters that don't.
"Sent back: These gaiters don't have elastic around the foot like others I have seen. It was hard to tell from the picture. For my intended purposes, snow would get in and around my foot."
"Do you know who the Fat Lady really is?: If you are a philosopher at heart and immensely interestedin the human psyche, then this book is integral for thought.I am not just writing this because I am fascinated by J.D.Salinger, rather these two stories explore religion,pyschology, the bonds among family members, and theeverpresent quest for a unique vision of life.""Franny"" is the story of a troubled philosophical girl whois struggling to reconcile her thoughts on her world purposeand the conventions of daily existence. ""Zooey"" is the confidentolder brother who understands many things that his sister doesnot. These stories, especially ""Zooey"" have humor, sadness,cynicism, and joy. For anyone who is always questioningand looking for an answer, Salinger speaks to thatquestioning voice and offers his own idea of who the Fat Ladyreally is."
"Good, but never catch up to Catcher: When I was reading it I felt nothing. It was just an average book- good writing, but no meaning. As I go over it I reaize all the symbolism, the chicken soup, the snowman paper-weight, and foremost religion.Due to the suicide of Seymour Glass, Franny's religious beliefs are fluctuating. Franny was never able to accept religion before her uncle's suicide. However, now that she is trying to ""find herself,"" she is caught up in the vast world of religion. Her obvious relationship with religion is illustrated through the book she continues to carry around. However, through her subconscious actions she is depicted as never being able to accept religion. Though people continue to try and give Franny guidance, there still remains the reason for both her searching and her nervous breakdown."
"""1"" star, because 1/5 of the book was good: the first 1/5th of the book was good, had a good plot going, interesting characters, vintage salinger, the cynicism, the whole nine yards. but then it just went to hell in a handbasket, fizzled and puzzled and wuzzled and ultimately just became unreadable and DULL. god bless you if you can finish this book and have enjoyed the whole thing...i couldn't. indigestable."
"TERROR, TREACHERY & TENTACLES: Slayers is a parody about parodies, and Slayers Premium is no different. When Lina and Gourry enter a village famous for octopus they receive more than their famished intentions. The group of octopus that reside in the sea can't take the heat of the frying pan and turn against the villagers by resurrecting a sea monster connected to a curse. The same curse happens to turn everyone into octopus-the first sign being talking in ""octopan,"" a bizarre gobblegoop language.All the characters are true to their zany personalities and giving the story the comedy that Slayers always is. Also, the art by Tommy O is awesome. I really liked this one --no heavy handed plots, just Slayers silliness from beginning to end."
Grammar in use: This is an excellent book for teaching students enjoy the exercises and find them a good self study and practice reference.
"Breathtaking Alaska DVD: I've always dreamed of taking an Alaskan Cruise and after watching this DVD I absolutely know now that I must! The mesmerizing footage of massive glaciers calving icebergs off into the ocean, humpback whales breaching, bald eagles soaring free, bears foraging, and incredible footage of the fjord cliffs themselves is all set to moving, beautiful music. This video made me feel as if I were right there experiencing the unspoiled nature and exciting wildness of Alaska. If this doesn't give you the travel bug nothing will!"
Spectacular footage: This is an amazing film filled with breathtaking imagery and beautifully composed music. I'd recommend this to all looking for a soothing experience as well as a fun ride.
"WIERD BUT WICKED TRIPPIN STUFF: I Grew Up Listening To The Dead cos My Ex-Hippie Parents Used To Play It All The Time, But Now Im Beginning To Get Into These Guys, Despite A Wierd Psychedelic Sound and Lyrics Which Seem To Be ""Out Of It"" I Reckon This Album Deserves All. I Love It. and Remember KEEP TRIPPIN HARD WHEN LISTENING TO THE DEAD"
"Nice people who can't sing: I'm sure this group was lots of fun at parties and very pleasant conversationalists. However, they can't sing a note and can barely play their instruments. One of the worst records ever made, worse than Soft Machine, and that's saying something."
"Mostly unlistenable: I have heard virtually all of the Dead's recorded output and generally like them, but isn't this really an album which is more interesting to think about than it is fun to actually listen to? A grand experiment which mostly failed. Needed a rigorous editing job and someone to say ""no"" to the excesses which wreck it. The live versions of these songs on other Dead albums, recorded during the same time period, are far superior."
"Love It To Death Is Right: This record, Killer, School's Out, and Billion Dollar Babies are all Must Haves. I became aware of Alice cooper through this album. I was only 12. Who is this Alice Cooper guy? Great stuff. One of the greatest live performers ever."
"Warner Brothers should be ashamed of these releases....: First off, all of the original Alice Cooper band albums are more than worthwhile. Get them all....on vinyl that is.These low priced CD's that Warner Brothers is peddeling are the original transfers from back when the CD was first introduced. Terrible hiss and poor sound quality make these unlistenable in my opinion. I have MP3's and cassettes of these albums that sound much better than these factory WB CD releases do.I also own all of them on vinyl and can firmly attest that the AC band catalouge is in DIRE need of a remaster. Save your bucks until that happens or listen on vinyl/cassette until then. Don't encourage these guys. Shame on you Warner Brothers for continuing to sell such outdated/poor quality transfers!!"
"works well: The first one I received was inaccurate, but the company immediately sent another that was fine. The thermometer has been very useful and effective."
Great gift for the girl who has it all!: Too funny! I bought this because I knew it would make a great gift and I was right! Very funny!
"Rwcord quality problem.: I made two attempts to buy this new edition of Tupelo Honey and both had defects. On both albums defects were found on ""Old Woodstock"" and ""I want to roo you"" After the second one had the same issue as the first I asked for a refund. I would be wary of this pressing until we see that the quality control has improved. On the bright side it was simple and easy to do the returns with Amazon. A great job on the Amazon customer service side of the issue."
"Happy with this CD: Rare song ""Tupelo Honey"" is on this CD. Along with a couple other hits.I got what was promised. Sound quality is good.I would recommend this product."
"Certainly the place to start-- the very best survey: I read this in its original 1967 edition when I was very young, and it inspired a life-long love of horror films (at that time the Science Fiction content was not in the title, though it was found in the book). Clarens' effort is clear and concise-- not too much on any one thing, but he manages to hit all the necessarys and high spots. It's really indispensible for the fan who's starting out in a serious study of the subject-- or who just loves horror."
Wrong one!: I had hoped to surprise my sister with a movie of the 'Blue Rosé' for Christmas...one where we had watched together as children in the 60's. Two days after Christmas she called to tell me it was an earlier version that had no talking! I paid for the deluxe version and it was the wrong one...now I have a movie I will never watch.. Just be careful you read everything because I obviously didn't..
"Too old: My husband, who is a Movie Buff, thought this was just too old a version. We are returning it."
"Neat Product: I added these as stripes to our office space and I was able to accomplish just the look I was going for (retro chic). The colors are fun and added some zest to our light grey walls. It was my first time using wall-pops so it took me a minute to get the hang of hanging them. The best part is that they are removable and can be reapplied over and over, so the product was very flexible with my beginner status. I am so glad I purchased them and will definitely be using them again. My fiancé also really likes our office and said we should use them in more rooms of our house!"
Awesome: I like Black Sabbath - the originals. My favorite albums are the first six but I am looking forward to the new one in April 2013 performed by the original members.
"STILL waiting for a TRUE ""Deluxe Edition"": I just don't understand why record companies release CD after CD calling them new and improved. CDs are low-fi crap no matter what you add to it. All the fancy packaging and additional music will never change that fact. It's still low-resolution 16 bit old technology.I don't see why they don't release a TRUE ""Deluxe Edition"" and give us an SACD as they did with the release of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's Brain Salad Surgery. It's phenomenal and a TRUE ""Deluxe Edition""."
"Crime and Punishment: I thought that Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment was a great book. It was suspenseful, captivating, and well-written. The characters seemed very real and life-like. It was very graphic and detailed, describing even to the last of the feelings of Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov before, during, and after the murder. The details of the scenes of the murder, the police station, and the trampling of Marmeladov were very explicit and well-written. The only bad points of the book are the use of Old English spelling and grammar, and that the story is sometimes hard to follow. The book has excellent detail and was captivating and full of suspense. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to tackle the 493 pages. Overall, it was a good book."
"IMO please avoid this fine translator: Constance Garnett: Listen carefully: when you read a work translated, the translator makes a big difference. Constance Garnett is a fine translator, but she tends to literally translate (not literal as in a machine translation, but rather, so no word is lost). This tends to make the book wordy and grates on many people's nerves (not just mine--read the other reviews here)CAVEAT EMPTOR. You have been warned. A better, more modern translator might be: Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky.And as they say in Russian: ""If you don't believe it, take it as a fairy tale"" (translated)."
"I hated it!: I felt like my crime was buying the book and my punishment was reading it. I bailed out mid-way when I could no longer ignore that the characters constantly reminded me of the ""two wild and crazy guys"" from Saturday Night Live. The idea for the book was good but, at least to me, the characters were idiotic and boring. Given the acclaim and popularity of this book, I'm sure that my opinion is in the minority, if not altogether alone."
great: CLASSIC Wonderful price and book..FREE Easy to read and the price is right...FREE. You can't go wrong with this product. !!!! Awesome
Crime and Punishment: Definitely a 4 star read. I read this book in college and now again and it remains a literary classic. This style is sometimes hard to follow with the Russian names but well worth your time.
"Great but not perfect!: Great affordable copy of Crime and punishment. The translation is ... okay not the best not the worst. For the price, if you want to have a copy laying around or are buying as a gift for someone who hasn't read it, sure! It's a great gift/spare copy!"
"Didn't Like It: It's probably me, since this is a classic but I just could not get through it. I even had my Kindle read it to me on my way to and from work but it was just so boring and hard to get into."
"Warning, very long-winded!!: As an avid reader, I was told that Crime and Punishment was one of the best books written. I found it to be very long winded, though, and after suffering through it once, do not wish to read it ever again. I agree with the reader before me who said ""if you love Tolstoy you'll hate Destoevsky."" I'm am now finishing Anna Karennina and absolutely love it!"
"Wrenching.: I, personally, found the Brothers Karamazov better in many ways, but the themes in Crime and Punishment come out more loudly than in the BK which come out extremely loudly in themselves. A university student justifies the murder of an old woman who is a cold and cruel pawn shop owner. For the next few days the student, Raskolnikov, struggles with his feelings of remorse, guilt, doubt, etc. until he gives in for the sake of others, though he doesnt consciously recognize it and some might disagree. It is a marvelous work on the human psychy and a must read."
"No help at all.: I'll make it brief, because there's already so much out there in these reviews. I bought this to see if I wanted to use this course to learn some Spanish so I could converse with some of the many Hispanic people we have here in our California environs. No help. Perhaps for a visit to Spain? Our Hispanic friends here do not speak this ""dialect (?)."" It is also very, very slow and I kind of resent paying this much for a ""sample"" of what proves to be a very expensive course. At the end of the second plodding CD, I am able to ask somebody if they are from North America. Gee, now why would I ask that of one of our obviously Mexican-American neighbors?Whatever."
"You can do this!: This is a very good set of cd's and I'm busy learning conversational Spanish. I know French and these tapes are teaching me to think in Spanish and not French; and correcting my pronunciation. I knew the very, very, very basics of Spanish before this but I think I will be able to relax and converse much better in Mexico now!"
Muy Bien: I have always wanted to learn Spanish and so I have bought several things to help. This is by far the best of them because i actually took this on an eight hour trip with a family member and we loved learnign from it. It is correct when it says you learn spanish quickly. So if you buy it and are taking a trip stop at an authentic Mexican place and try out your new found knowledge after disc #2. You will surprised what you know about the language.
Pet set: Adorable. This again was purchased with the house for my 5 year old grandson. He adores playing with all of the rooms and funiture;
"What the %$&*...is this?: (SMH)...ok..I did not order this one through Amazon although, they have amazing speed in getting your items to you which is great. Anyway, I picked up this cd.... I was so disappointed in this cd...it's too commercial and I feel as if they have really gotten away from their roots and love for music with this cd. It's like they just needed to put a cd out instead of having passion. It gets NO airplay in the ride! I would not even suggest it to complete the collection unless you want to waste your money. YMMV. NEOSOUL06"
"Not worth the paper it was printed on: This ""book"" is full of the same old garbage that EVERY health organisation in the world has, in the past decade, proven wrong. Any book that would seriously quote a sit-com isnt worth a dime. I love Seinfeld and took the foreskin comments for what they were: jokes. This should be filed under fiction. If the foreskin was so hazardous to a mans health why has mankind thrived for the past 2 million years without circumcision? Because the foreskin is not deadly which is why I left my son intact. He has had no problems of any kind at all. Reading books like this only makes me feel better about leaving my son intact because this book marks a new low for the pro-circumcision camp and shows just how desperate they've become in the lack of medical evidence.Very sincerly from a circumcised dad who's just a bit envious of his intact son."
The best Dead CD recorded: Working Man's Dead depicts everything the Dead stood for (Garcia rest in harmony). This recording is a classic because of the jazzy themes and the bluegrass genre. Uncle John's Band being my favorite song of all times because of the pure optimisim and the methodical rhythm. Can't complian here! And I would recommend this CD to first time listeners of the Dead because it is easy to follow and even easier to love. two thumbs up!
"Ballin' that jack...: The 8 track version of this lived in my player for 3 months back in the '70's! Great production, Great arrangement, Great MUSIC! You don't have to be a Deadhead to enjoy Workingmans Dead. Favorite tune: High Time ...livin' the good liiife. Best tune: Uncle John's Band ...Come hear Uncle John's Band playing to the tide... Coolest tune: New Speedway Boogie ...It's got no signs or dividing lines and very few rule to guide.Jerry we miss ya!!!"
"Hasn't Aged Well: I was a *huge* Dead fan in high school and college and still like some of their music, such as ""Live-Dead"" (best effort, I say) and ""Europe '72,"" but I think ""American Beauty"" & ""Workingman's Dead"" are merely pleasant. In fact, Workingman's Dead verges on hippie easy-listening. Musically, there's nothing special here at all, and the lyrics are forgettable.I put this one in the ""how did I ever think this was a great album?"" category."
"Soothingly Superb: If you are looking for tranquility, Spiritual Lullabies is for you. Heaven Exists is my personal favorite, this CD is definitely for the whole family...Thanks Christine for such a soothing, superbly composed CD. ~Kholi"
Widespread panic review: Product came to me in one week and was in perfect condition. This is a great Widespread panic CD and virtually every tune is great.
Just what I needed: I needed extra wire for my electric fence so I ordered the 17 gauge aluminum wire.Product came promptly and was just as described.I am quite satisfied with this product.
"Ego Friendly:: Albeit it's almost a classic now, The Beloved had it going on with Happiness; it's dreamy, soothing, and melodic. The vocal style is sensual and deep, the lyrics, positive and real. Musically, it's mixed with a cool balance of guitar and synth, with upbeat as well as slower tracks. It has a certain moodiness that is unique.Some of my favorites are: ""Hello""-Jams!/""Your Love Takes Me Higher""/""Time After Time""/""Don't You Worry""/""Wake Up Soon."""
play script purchase: The book was shipped in a timely fashion and arrived in the condition i expected. the seller is most reliable and i would purchase other merchandise from him again.
This was a very good book.: This was the first of Sue Civil Brown's that I have read. It made me want to read her other books. I hope Sue Civil Brown will keep on writing as I want to keep on reading her books.
This book is a shadow of her Rachel Lee books.: I have read all three of these books and this is the last one I will read. There is no substance to any of these books.
"noodling that goes nowhere: Back in the early 70s, a friend whose opinion I had great respect for, told me this was ""the best album ever recorded."" So I went out and bought it. I wish I had borrowed his instead, and saved the money. (I know that no band has a more loyal following than the Dead, but frankly, I've never been able to catch the vision.) This recording, like all Dead recordings, at least in my ear, sounds like pointless ""noodling"" combined with weak vocals and mediocre songs. If I want to listen to some JAMMING, give me the Allman Brothers FILLMORE CONCERTS! (Of course, if you eat enough good LSD, ANYTHING sounds good, right?!?)"
"This book does a good job explaining the basics of Python.: This book does an excellent job explaining how to use Python in general, including internet programming. It also includes a CD that enables the buyer to set up Python on their own system, be it Win95, Dos, Unix, etc. Unfortunately, this CD does not include a setup program. It does include some instructions for setting it up, however, this is not a straightforward process. I would recommend this book only for someone who has at least little programming experience and knowledge of their operating system."
"A Conroy Classic: Conroy is the best of the best. Theres no better author at writing gut wrenching, heart stomping, laughter filled family sagas rich with strong appealing characters that you love to detest. This is not my favorite Conroy masterpiece, but I do believe it is the best. The characters in this story are like no other you will ever read. You will learn to hate certain charecters, yet at the same time you cant help loving them. I am utterly jealous of anyone who gets to read this book for the first time. If only I could go back in time........ Its that good!"
"Growing up Marine: I read this book because I grew up in the Marine Corps. My mother was in for 20 years, and we moved at least 8 or 9 times that I can remember. I had to laugh at some of the descriptions because it was a lot like growing up with my mom. Except she was not quite so competitive. I have been to Beaufort South Carolina where the book takes place. I thought the story was very good and the descriptions were excellent."
"Just buy the single: To me this album was a desperate attempt by corgan to regain the stature the Pumpkins gained with Melancholy and Siamese dream. The detuned guitars, vocals, and novel lyrics seem forced. The only real jem on this album is Stand Inside Your Love. It is a one of the best ballads Corgan has ever writen. It's beautiful lyrics key in perfectly with the soaring guitar solo and detuned harmony. Other than that songs like ""Heavy Metal Machine"" a terrible attempt at that same title and ""I of the Morning"" a failed ballad ruin the rest of the album. On the bright side: at least they got their drummer back."
"Pleasant: This CD Is OK- i liked all their other albums better (though I havent heard gish yet...) Siamese Dream was the best. And this comes in 4th.But I still really like this. My favorite song is Stand Inside Your Love- the lyrics are very moving. I also like Glass and Ghost Children, Wound is really cool, With Every light is peaceful. Most of the songs are listenable, some are extremely likable. Hopefully Everlasting Gaze and Stand Inside Your Love will be popular on the radio so the backstreet nsync thing wears out and the pUmpkins can be the gods of TRL and the radio. That would be schweet. Machina is worth a good listen. Possibly good music to sleep too. I thought the album would be heavy rock like everlasting gaze and heavy metal machine. But those are the only two songs. Most else actually sounds similar to Adore though Corgan say's it doesnt and nobody else does. I dunno, maybe its just me. Anyhow, give Machina a shot."
"Smashing Pumpkins Paint-by-Numbers: Wow. Easily the worst Pumpkins album. Machina II, available via Internet only, is so much better, and it's free. This album is a formulaic, uninspired, as subtle-as-a-jackhammer ""effort."" ""Everlasting Gaze"" sounds like a Pumpkins self-parody. Corgan's a cappella bridge borders on the ridiculous, and the song contains none of the swells and sways that characterized their seminal songs, such as ""Tonight, Tonight,"" ""1979,"" ""Zero,"" or ""Cherub Rock."" Those who say this is a better album than ""Adore"" need their ears re-examined. Those expecting ""Adore"" to be a typical Pumpkins hard-rocking effort are bound to be disappointed, but in my opinion ""Adore"" rocks so much harder than Machina in its subtlety and emotion. In fact, ""Adore"" is one of SP's best albums. Machina sounds like some second-rate poseur band trying to copy the Pumpkins formula and failing miserably."
"Among the most painful CDs of recent memory: If you enjoy going to your dentist you'll have no trouble loving this album. Not only is the music totally unoriginal, but the Pumpkins insist on drowning it all with heavily distorted bass chords that seem to be a pet peeve of the recording engineer. Add to that the self-consciously and mostly impenetrable nasal voice of Corgan and you get a band who seems to be making a quick point of entry as your garden variety vegetables."
"machina - not much to be desired.: machina - the machines of god is, in my opinion, quite likely the worst pumpkins release to date. the songs are for the most part boring and unmelodic. (and this coming from a die-hard pumpkins fan!) even adore had fairly strong melodies throughout. also, machina was promised to be the pumpkins striking back at the world that scorned them. it was touted to be their new rock and roll anthem. i find this album almost completely devoid of rock, with few exceptions (i.e.-the everlasting gaze, heavy metal machine). the pumpkins seem to have lost their flair for beautiful riff-based songs. listen to siamese dream and then compare with the new machina. the new release has virtually no catchy guitar hooks. i understand the princeple of musical evolution, but i think that we've lost the pumpkins that we'd come to know and love. they've de-volved into something that, quite frankly, i just don't understand or appreciate."
"New music for a new millenium: Many of the songs on the CD do bring back a nostalgic feeling of the Pumpkins of old, but their new sound definitely helps to build on the idea of keeping things fresh. Never one to just sit back and do that same thing over and over, Billy Corgan helps to bring this entire album together with his familiar vocals. The first song, Everlasting Gaze, is an incredibly powerful piece that is reminiscent of the Pumpkins earlier work, but still has a taste of something new. All in all a great buy, and any true Pumpkins fan will enjoy it."
"Inspiration Yes, Trepidation No: The Pumpkins are a legendary band. All their albums have some musical merit, regardless of the extremists contentions. Machina, taken as a singular production detached from SP's previous work, is a excellent album. Rife with riffs, muddled with melancholy, this last album by the Pumpkins (presumably, D'arcy is out) will please."
"astounding: this is a marvelous album, and a huge departure from Adore, although that was a great album as well. The thing about the Pumpkins is that their songs vary wonderfully, and Adore was great for what it was:a pop album.On Machina, Billy is once again gripping the music industry by the balls in his pale hands. Strong, tight songs like, ""Stand Inside Your Love,"" and, ""This Time,"" meld into languid, neo-psychedelic jams like, ""Glass and the Ghost Children.""But while Billy's songwriting is still as fresh as ever, one of the main highlights of the album is Jimmy Chamberlin's drumming, which is phenomenal. He totally goes nuts on, ""The Everlasting Gave,"" and, ""I of the Mourning,"" but still remains in the background.This album is proof that the Pumpkins can do anything. They are excellent as a pop band, but if they truly want to rock, the only person who can keep up with them is Jimmy."
"""let me die"" instead of listening to this record: i'm a huge SP fan and i saw them on their resume the pose tour but i'm so embarassed for the smashing pumpkins man. this is an atrocious record and a betrayal for those who really idolized Billy. i am starting to not like billy because he thinks that HE (not even his band) can save rock and roll. the only thing this album does is put rock and roll out of its bloody misery......billy, it's time to retire......i liked gish and siamese dream, this just sucks (i don't recall songs as bad as sunshowers and that heavy metal song since freakin adore)"
really flat: Billy Corgan is a very dull artist.the Lyrics are more self-pity than anything else.if he wants to willow in saddness and do it right then listen to Van Morrison.the music sounds flat and desperate.theirs no Life in the Smashing Pumpkins music.this disc at best is 2nd rate outtakes.Billy Corgan needs to get over himself and become a Artist again.he is just a Spoil Rich Brat.stop with the WHimp Lyrics and Write some Real songs for a change.the music is Weak as well.
"Not up to expectations, sadly...: I had high hopes for this album after the first single, ""Stand Inside Your Love"", which encapsulates everything that the Pumpkins do best. Unfortunately, the single proved to be an exception. Which is not to say that the album is terrible - those fans who appreciate the heavier moments of previous Pumpkins albums will probably find much to their satisfaction here. If, however, you are buying it with hopes that there is anything with the majestic beauty of ""Tonight Tonight"" or ""Thirty Three"", don't waste your money - instead, buy the single. The artwork is amazing, but unfortunately the album is overlong, bloated and ultimately unnecessary. A great shame and a wasted opportunity, alas..."
"Very Nice: If their intention was to create something beautiful, I think the Smashing Pumpkins have done it with Machina. You have to be in the right mood (calm), and listening with headphones. And you have to listen. Really take it in. And don't judge. Just listen. The lyrics are beautiful. The sounds are beautiful. The songs I didn't care for are Heavy Metal Machine and Blue Skies Bring Tears. I found less melody in them. Everything else is mesmerizing. And you can hear the emotion and resolve in Corgan's voice. I love his style of singing. If you take each song as simply a musical creation and judge it only against what your perception of beautiful music is, I believe most of you will not be disappointed. ""Desolation yes hesitation no"" I love these lyrics. I think the entire album conveys a feeling of desolation, yet hope and resolve."
"out with a bang: I wanna start by saying this review is for machina I and II hence the max rating allowed now onto the music machinaI carries some of the murky vibe from adore but at times musicialy is lush sounding with some of the better power pop i've herd in a long while stand out tracks stand inside your love, This time, Try Try Try, Crying tree of mercury.Machina II offers up two disc with deffing yet familuar styles at times reminding you the bands other two disc offering shame it was never released standout tracks Real love, Slow down Vanity, Lucky 13 Dross If their is a god, Let me give the world to you, all and all a fitting epitah for this great band buy M 1 D/lMIIyou wont be sorry thanks billy"
pumpkins = god! 2000 shooting stars: if you want to hear what the pumpkins sound like listen to siamese dream and gish if you want to hear what a huge ego sounds like through speakers listen to adore and machina machina is even worse than the ever boring adore because it is obvious that smashing pumpkins are a moneyhungry and trying to imitate what sold the most records i hope billy finds a way to occupy his time other than making his band look like saints of rock! they are styx of this generation! ha ha i didnt get why kurt c HATED billy corgan until adore was released and this goes on prove it even more! bury it next 2 your spice girls cd!
"I'm Frankly Lamer: I can't say on other portions of Frank's life, but with respect to the Bonnie and Clyde material this book is full of inaccuracies. The authors make the dire mistake of reprinting contemporary newspaper accounts as fact. For example, Bonnie had nothing to do with the grapevine killings, but this book states she kicked one officer over and shot him in the head, as was misreported at the time.Other items also make one wonder if they know what they are talking about -- the book identifies a very clear picture of W.D. Jones as Clyde Barrow! This is unforgivable and makes everything else in the book highly suspect. This book might make a good drink coaster but it's a little large."
"Terrible copy quality: It is scandalous that Amazon carries this item. The copy is so riddled with typographical errors, including streams of symbols and letters combined, that often the text is rendered nonsensical and indecipherable. Whatever my view of Wesley's doctrine might be, I would appreciate being able to analyze it using a text that benefited from the attention of simple copy editing at the most basic level. There literally are hundreds of errors in this copy, which makes reading it unproductive."
not noted: Would have been helpful to know that this piece was unfinished. We bought two of them for a child care center and were not prepared to have it stained and sealed.
"After reading this you will not want to turn the lights off!: I was a regular a Bobby Mackeys for a period of time, I myself have never had anything happend to me, but I knew of alot of people in the book. Im still a skeptic on whether things really did happen, but the book is excellent. I could not put it down, it was very suspensful, and very scary. I love scarry movies, but this book really scared me, there were plenty of times I could not go to sleep at night, for thinking of the book. I recommend this book for good entertainment, and for a good chill up the spine."
Hellsgate Terror at Bobby Mackey's Music World: My friend wanted this book for years. We never could find it at the book stores. Someone told her to try Amazon and we found it on the first try. She says it is the best book ever.
"Nice to have but.........: This remasted disc is nice with the bonus tracks and spiffed up sound, but the only way top hear Aoxomoxoa is to find a original W7 (Warner Brothers-Seven Arts) green label vinyl pressing. The CD features the 1971 remix (like the 1989 CD) in which 1/3 of the backing has been stripped like Constanten's prepared backrounds on ""What's Become Of The Baby"", the extra drums and barbershop vocal on ""Doin That Rag"". St Stephen lost something in the remix as well. Anthem was remixed as well in 1972 but the band was wise to issue the 1968 mix on CD. No hidden goodies on this disc, but the bonus tracks are great."
"Great Melodic Death Metal: I picked this up because of the cover and the description from a metal music web site. I was not disappointed. The music is melodic yet chaotic, loud, obnoxious, speedy, all the good things one would expect from the genre including the ""Cookie Monster"" vocals. The bonus disc has a remixed version of the original release with an extra song thrown in, plus after the regular album plays, there are multiple bonus tracks. This is a great collection and introduction to their sound. The only problem is that their creative force just offed himself. He was released a while back after spending time in jail on a murder conviction. Made a sort of comeback, but abruptly stopped the band and killed himself. I can't help not thinking of all that crap as I listen to this. If that doesn't bother you, I recommend this as a great introduction to melodic death. Recommended."
"Well, Three and a Half stars. I thought I would round up...: Dissection is by far not the best band to come out of Sweeden, although I take a lot of criticizm for that statement! I like the cd to an extent, but if it wasnt for the song ""Where Dead Angels Lie"" this album would pretty much suck, and I would have given it two stars. The recording isnt the best and the the vocals are drowned out by the noise in the background. Eventhough the guitaring is a little repetative, Dissection has some of the coolest riffs I have ever heard, especially their accoustic sections featured throughout the album. So I guess I will recommend this cd even though I dont like it a whole too lot. But, if I may make one more sugestion, check out Opeth's: ""My Arms Your Hearse"" album if you havent already, that cd totaly kicks a*s!"
"BEWARE SECOND-HAND SALES OF THIS ITEM!: I have ordered this item twice in the past two weeks through Amazon Marketplace. Although each time I received my order promptly, IN EACH INSTANCE THE SECOND DISC WAS MISSING! This 2-disc set is in completely separate disc cases, and if you are not paying attention, it is quite easy to not notice that the case is labeled ""Disc One"" on the spine and in the back text. As much as I would like to have a physical copy of this CD set, I can't take another chance that I am only going to get half my order again so I'm giving up and just ordering this on iTunes."
"A Man and His Music: Good for diehard fans only. Beware of the fact that only ONE disc is offered through Amazon. I know not what to do about obtaining full two-disc set,but it's worth finding out."
"Peter, Paul and Mary: I like this music because it takes me back to the middle to late 60,s. This the kind of music I like"
"Peter, Paul and Mommy: We gave this CD to our three-year-old granddaughter and within months, to the delight of her parents, she was singing along. Using music alone, no television screen, gives a child the opportunity to use its imagination--imagine that! How wonderful."
"awful: I recently purchased a Senseo. After brewing my 1st cup, I almost took it back. The Senseo coffee is awful. But, I went to my local grocery store and purchased some Yuban Columbian coffee pods. What a difference. It is pretty good - actually tastes and smells like real coffee. I can't say the same for the Senseo brand. I look forward to trying other brands."
"Not long lasting: First to go was the lamp, that cost approx. 5 bucks to replace! Next to go was the transformer. product lasted about two months. Great while it lasted.....once burned never again!"
"scott august: great , wonderfully relaxeing. Beautiful scenery. Even better after fact of seeing a few of sights in person and also nice to see sights i would of loved to visit"
"makes you awe at woolf's ability to write....excellent: So im a 17 year girl who read this for fun in 2 days. the first 30 pages are tough, especially if you arent used to the language. this is my first book by VW. I came away amazed at woolf's ability to write, she is now my favorite female writer ever. One thinks it is only the story of mrs dalloway but it contains lives of others. I love septimus. ALl i can say is that it kicks butt and you should read it."
"Amazing book, great gift!: I bought it for a friend and so far he loves it. The edition is good (got the paperback one) :)"
"One of the best ever....: No, this book is not pulp fiction, nor will it ever show up on anyone's summer reading list, but it is, given time and patience, one of the all time best examples of the written word at it's very zenith.I read the book in college and then re-read it right after finding Michael Cunningham's THE HOURS and seeing Vanessa Redgrave in the movie. Clarissa Dalloway is one of the most carefully developed characters in fiction. Additionally, Woolf's detailed and exquisite interiors are worth savoring -- almost word by word.Woolf was one of the great voices of the English language. Her work compels the reader to slow down and feel the words.Enjoy!"
"Great book; horrible Kindle edition: I would give the book 4 or 5 stars, but this Kindle edition barely rates 2. The formatting is awful, and the publisher didn't even bother to remove hyphens. It's cheap, but even so, this edition is not worth the money."
Help me!: I was happily grazing in the sunny uplands of my home town library when I was cornered by the insatiable Wolf. Come quick. I have survived the rapids of her flowing subconscious but am stuck in her growling semicolons.Help. I'm seeing light at the wrong end of the tunnel
"Quite possibly the worst piece of literature I have ever read.: As I sit here trying to write an essay for this book for my AP English class, I get more and more frustrated with the crock of horse crap that is this book. There is nothing to say about this book other than that it's about whiny rich British people being whiny rich British people. Unless your idea of excitement is attempting to immerse yourself in pretentious 20th century drivel about party planning, stay far away from this book. Far, far away. If you want a stream of consciousness book that's far more exciting and engaging, try Faulkner's As I Lay Dying."
"a meandering and pointless novel: I just finished this book, and I'm still not quite sure what it is I've read. Filled with run-on sentences and paced slower than a tortoise, this book is truly a chore to read. There is no point to this novel; it is simply an account of a day in the life of an airheaded wench and those who have been unfortunate enough to know her. There is no closure at the end, for there is no plot for which closure is needed. The characters are varied, but I really never became interested in any of them. However, on a more positive note, this book will suffice as kindling should the need arise."
"easy to use, convenient: Advertisements for Nordic Walking poles claim up to 40% increase in calories burned. I don't think I've seen that level of increase - but then again, if I had it would probably make my walk far more exhausting and less fun. I find the poles add a nice arm workout to my exercise. The poles are very light. The technique is very easy to pick up.It is easy to adjust the height of these poles. Most reviews say that you should not get telescoping poles, but rather get ones sized for your height. The benefit of these poles is that they are in three segments, rather than 2, so they collapse small enough for travel. They could easily be thrown in a carry-on bag or kept in a larger desk drawer at work."
"EXCELLENT BOOK: This is an excellent book, especially if one is interested in experiencing the glory of God as I am. Very enlighening and easy to read! I recommend it to anyone who is in doubt and looking for a faith builder."
"Japanese, Conversationa:Pimsleur: Great way to learn conversational japanese, especially if you are commuting every day. Would have liked to have some kind of internet link to also start to learn to write the words I am learning on the audio."
"Poor plot, poor acting, poor FX: Venus Rising is a thriller set in the near future, where an island prison has been abandoned by the authorities and the inmates left to starve. Years later, three inmates make an escape from the island and find themselves on Pacifica, an island paradise where bored rich people find stimulation in virtual reality. Murder and identity switching ensue, as the authorities hunt for the escapees.This movie basically steals plot elements from Wild Palms and Strange Days and does a worse job than either of those two movies. For a start, the acting is weak, with a bunch of third tier talent like Billy Wirth and Costas Mandylor. Morgan Fairchild serves no purpose in this movie. The only actor with some salt was Audie England, whose only other roles seem to be in Zalman King type erotica.This movie also obviously had a lousy budget. Even the scenes where they are meant to be entering virtual reality are hokey."
"Good Book!: This book is an easy read and has lots of common sense advice on how to become a millionaire for the average joe. The only downside I see in this book is trying to count on an average 10% return on the stock market. I don't see that as realistic. But otherwise, an excellent book with great ideas that are easy to implement. - Aimee Elizabeth, Author of Poverty Sucks! How to Become a Self-Made Millionaire."
"my ears my ears!!!: Absinthe Blind is by far the worst band to ever come out of the famed champaign-urbana music scene, there second album is no better then their first...if not worse...1 star is the minimum i could give it...i would give it worse if possible....repetative and i detect way to much of a pink floyd influence."
"Sizing was way too big.: i ordered a ladies large and it was like a men's extra large. Other than that, it was nice and fluffy. I loved the purple color."
"A- MAZING!!!!!!: I picked up this book on a whim and was happily surprised. Unlike other ""How to be an Actor"" books this book a motivational tool. Monroe is the Tony Robbins of the entertainment biz. I have felt a renewed sense of direction and power over my life since reading this book. Everything that Monroe says is right on the money and he gives the reader a great lookout on everyday aspects of our lives.If you haven't read this or Monroe's other book From Benning and Back pick them both up and get motivated today.... The man is like 25 and is accomplishing big things, he doesn't jst talk the talk, he runs full speed to his goals."
"outstanding disc showcasing the full range of Smith's talent: Lavay Smith, Tuesday night swing party staple at the Top of the Mark in San Francisco, shows off her voice on this outstanding disc. Her band, the Red Hot Skillet Lickers, has remained remarkably unchanged over the years, still producing the tightest set of any West Coast swing band."
"An excellent introduction and reference for the theory and fundamentals: This is a text book for engineers (electrical and mechancial primarily) to learn about various kinds of electric machines and their fundamental theories of operation and design. This is one of the best of those books and not meant to be one that is picked up by the casual ""tinker"" or even an engineer looking for a quick application guide to DC motors. This is a thorough text book on these devices for those who need to engineer for design objectives."
"Not Worth It...: This cheaply made book may be able to claim that it contains all of Sorayama's images, but the reproduction quality is poor, on cheap paper, and many of the best images are split down the middle by the spine/seam of the book, making them look even cheaper than this book already makes them appear. Not worth your money, unless all you want are tiny lousy quality images on tissue paper. Sorayama deserves better."
"Scalpmaster Economy Wash-clothes are not well made.: The first time I washed the wash-clothes a couple of them raveled because the hems were too narrow. Another one raveled in the next washing. I use these every day. I have some that were bought as seconds that have held up for 5 years - better made and thicker. The seconds have finished edges rather than hemmed. I did not expect the clothes to be luxurious, but I did expect better than I got. Also, I resent them being foreign made - and not marketed as such."
"Great product: My husband has been using this cream for many years. Just recently we are unable to find this product in our local stores. When I found it online, he was excited."
"Delicious!: I have been drinking Senseo coffee for a couple of years now, trying different kinds. The Sumatra is delicious; I believe the pods in general are much more flavorful than the K-cup options, which have become very popular now."
"Ever have car dealer waiting room coffee?: I am completely disappointed in this product. Got the machine at a second hand store to try it out. Let's make it short and say save your money. The senseo pods are stale right out of the package. I have been drinking coffee for a long time and know that it will taste as good as it smells out of the package. SO if you smell dry cereal or grain instead of rich sweet coffee before you brew it, you know what you're in store for."
"Great coffee: Since I have had my Senseo coffee maker, I would rather go without than drink anything else."
"Dated, but still a great read: Henryck Sienkiewicz was a Polish writer who enjoyed huge popularity in Europe over one hundred years ago. His works were historical epics celebrating heroic eras in the life of a country that hadn't existed for decades, having been swallowed up in cynical power deals orchestrated by its neighbors, Austria, Prussia and Russia. He chose themes with strong appeal to his fellow Poles and it was not surprising that at some point he would turn to a narrative with strong religious content. Quo Vadis was an international best seller and has been turned into films many times. It is a well written romance come adventure story of love, faith and hope recounting Roman emperor Nero's persecution of the early Christians. Sienkiewicz's handling of the historic detail is impressive and his characters in the main are convincing, three dimensional human beings. It is an engaging, thought-provoking read."
"One star is OK because of Bob and Jane: Well, you can enjoy this movie even without buying it: just sit in front of your TV, turn it off right away and you'll get just about the same amount of excitement out of your evening."
"Favorite ,movie ever: My favorite movie ever. I bought these for myself and two daughters as it was our snuggle with popcorn movie time. Fast service too."
"My Robert Redford Collection: One of his first, and so glad to be able to get it!!! A delightful comedy!!"
iloveshoes: I love this scent. I have worn it for casual events for several years. A great everyday fragrance.
Dull: Implausible story involving hawks that can steer ships and wipe tears from the heroine's face. Love story wasn't believable or interesting.
"Polar bear 12 pack: The polar bear 12 is a great product that does what it advertised. With proper ice packs and starting with cool drinks it will easily keep drinks cold in Wilmington, NC. 90 degree days even if left in a hot car trunk that's in the sun. I now had 3 different size polar bears and gave away all my old coolers"
"Inspired and enlightened me: The first edition of Starware is a book I've read 3 or 4 times, and review every time I'm going to buy any thing related to astronomy. I'm planning on getting the 2nd edition soon. An invaluable source of solid information for a beginner or intermediate amatuer."
"Useless: It took me forever to get the lock to actually open, and then once I finally did unlock it, it wouldn't lock again. I would not recommend buying this unless you are okay with spending 15 minutes fiddling with it to unlock/lock it ."
"Seam came out after less than 2 months use: At first my husband loved this wallet--it fixed the giant bulging wallet problem for sure. However, after less than a couple of months of use (just past the return window time frame) the seam going between the two card slots on one side came undone. This makes the one side of the wallet virtually useless. The problem is, and you can see this if you look closely at the picture, that the seam only is about 3/4 of an inch long--it doesn't extend the length of the pocket. I'm sure that pulling cards in and out a few times a day would be better supported by a seam that runs the length of the pocket."
"Worth 1.99 (maybe) not 19.99: This is the cheapest possible piece of nylon (or similar material) sewed into a wallet shape. You would never buy this if you saw it in a store. It is a rip-off at this price. Amazon should be ashamed to carry this item. If you have a sense of humor, you will laugh, then get annoyed. Otherwise, you'll just be annoyed. How this could get good reviews is beyond my understanding."
"An utterly useless supplement.: This book follow's Stryer's book parallel and tells you ""Next, Stryer desribes...and then he describes...and then he goes a little deeper into..."" It is rather ridiculous that this book is at least as thick as the main text... DO NOT BUY THIS. It is completely unnecessary to own, apart from answering the few problems from Strye's book."
"Disjointed collection of documents and PK photographs: Considering the author was an officer and probably one of the better soldiers in the SSTK division this book is a huge disapointment. Ullrich's book consists of nothing more than a collection of maps, documents, and Propaganda Kompanie photographs that do little to explain history of probably one of the most remarkable and controversial divisions of the Waffen-SS. Karl Ullrich was with the division during its most critical engagements but provides the reader with no useful information or insite into the fighting qualities, organization or personalities of the 3 SS Panzer Division.I would recommend this book if you are only interested in pictures of SS men and SS equipment. As a historical document it leaves much to be desired."
"TOTALLY BEAUTIFUL AND INSPIRING!: I just love this book. I love the artwork on the cover and every word within. What spirited high consciousness! In one breath, this work lifted me up and at the same time kept me down to earth. I love how his writing combines opposites and how his beautiful wisdom comes through and often caught me unaware. This is a book to refer to time and time again."
Really nice quality: Very nice product. Good quality. Wears well. Large enough for good coverage. Other ones like this are usually small and thus cannot be wrapped properly. I HIGHLY recommend.
"Useful: Very nice piece of headdress, not so soft, not fancy, but it works in many forms, simple as many traditional tools but resistent and it has some style.This is made in Pakistan and the price is under its real value."
"In his lovely memory: This is a wonderful product, in the package there is such a beautiful stuff!You can remember the Bad Era in a full way and this is also such a moving feeling!I' ve cried a bit, after seeing and listening all the CDs.I recommend this product, no way!"
Michael Jackson 25th year Bad Deluxe: One of his best albums. 3 CDs and 1 concert Dvd. I have Thriller and like to have a couple of CDs from a musician so that I have an extended listening set.
"Bad Michael Jackson: I have the cassette tape of Bad and had decided it was time to purchase the CD. I love listening to music and it so happens this CD is ""BAD."""
"just excellent!: one of the best in his career!it's gotta be my favourite album.excellent lyrics,with music that i just can't seem to let go from!THANK YOU MICHAEL!"
"hello larry ...: ... let's just say: there was better music being made in detroit in the '70s. a little more entertaining, though, when you could see 'em shake it."
"CAN OPENER WITH AN ATTITUDE: It took two adults with college and medical degrees several times to figure out the proper positioning of the can-cutter blade. The safety edge resealable top is a nice feature but the edge of the can is sharp and anything but safe. Basicaly a good product, especially because it isn't electric dependent but the product and manual need reworkPolly OasLas Vegas, NV"
"House of Orange: I have been seeking a certain book that I read as a child; I thought that this book was it. It was not. That is no one's fault; I went by title alone. My problem was that, although I could get a total refund of my $20 for the book, it cost me over $10 to return the book. It came from the UK, and I was not astute enough at the time of my order to realize the costs involved in returning to a seller outside of the USA. Sue"
"Is it child-like or childish?: Like many of the readers (and reviewers) I expected a lot more from this book. It's a strange book at best; Gooch seems to be tied up with his very own boyfriend: Brad Gooch, of course. The pages are filled with sweet indulgences about himself, and there is very little insight that you might expect from a man who is pushing 50-plus. I chose the title of the review carefully, since either Gooch is very naive and/or has dumbed down his book for us needy folk, or he is a 7 year old stuck in a middle age man's body. Sadly, I suspect the latter."
"Do I have to give it even one?: Brad Gooch writes with stunning clarity about how beautiful he thinks he is, how fabulous his apartment is, and how easy it was for him to find inner peace being that he is actually just so terrific. This is self-indulgence, not self-help. His arrogance pours off the page as if he was drawing a cartoonish characterization of the overly self-involved gay men for the new milennium.Was interesting to see a mainstream publisher make an investment in ""gay self-help"" -- sadly, they have really, really missed the mark. ..."
"This is a joke, right?: That's what I thought when I saw the cover after unwrapping it (a gift). Then I read it, almost. My conclusion? We're doomed. How does this guy get hired to write anything? It's astoundingly bad. And he supposedly wrote a SERIOUS biography of Frank O'Hara? Hard to imagine after reading this. He must have terrible management."
Eh: Is very Deepak Chopra-esque. Almost feels like Mr. Gooch might be a closet schizo and this is his way of legitimizing a pathology....
"What A Shame: I picked Lars and the Real Girl up from the library thinking it was going to be a nice romantic comedy. It was my wife's birthday and she enjoys movies starring Ryan Gosling.Boy was I mistaken. This is an independent film about a guy who has some quirks... He decides to get a girl friend and chooses a life-sized doll.When he brings her over to meet his family, the ""comedy"" begins.Pretty soon the whole town is involved because the doctor believes Lars is suffering from some kind of delusion. Something happened to him when he was a boy. And I like how it was written in which you find out the cause.In watching the bonus features, the writer described why she wrote the story. She wanted to see what it would be like if people treated those with mental illnesses with compassion and love instead of ignorance.But other than that, I was disappointed by this film.Too bad too."
Lars: It was definetly funny but awkward. I watched it with my one of my girlfriends and we would look at each other with shock saying is this really happening!
It's cute....: The man (Ryan Gosling) always seems to amaze me. He can play just about any character. Nice to see people in an entire town come together.
"A Strange Movie: ""Lars and the Real Girl"" was an offbeat, but enjoyable film. Ryan Gosling gives a very strong performance as a neurotic, delusional nerd who falls in love with a life sized love doll. In this film, he is nothing like the romantic leading man of his recent films."
Defective Unable to use: Parts would not fit together. Holes for bolts also would not line up. Very defective. Looked like a manufacturing problem.
"ablounger: The ab lounge arrived sooner than I expected which was quite nice. Product was as advertised and works as expected. Doesn't fold up as easily as I would like, but maybe having to leave it out will make it more user friendly."
"EXERCISE is good, so they say: This chair was good, glad I found it and purchased it. It was hard to find one like this. particular one. to buy..."
"Product with no results: I bought this item for my wife after she had our baby. She is a naturally thin girl but gained a sufficient amount of weight during her pregnancy. She has always worked out and began again after having the baby. She lost all of the weight in her legs, and gluts. No results on stomach with this machine. She is NOT a lazy athlete and would spend up to 45 minutes doing crunches and had zero...NULL results. Never sore the next day and the machine never seemed to find her abs no matter how many positions she tried and believe me she tried MANY. Not recommended. Went to Sports Authority and did 25 crunches on a Marcy (crunch) ab bench and was VERY sore the next day. You can also buy this item on Amazon which in my opinion is a much better investment."
"Will not fit a standard 14'' marching snare drum.: In the description there is no mention in the size of this leveler. However, since the 14'' 12 lug snare drum is by far the most popular drum in the US, I assumed this would be an easy fit. This leveler is too small to attach across 3 of the lugs and too big to attach across 2 lugs. Since it was only $5, it would end up being more expensive to return it than to just eat the loss."
"House Histories: A Guide to Tracing the Genealogy of Your Home: Excellent book as a resource for old homes. So much great information. The only problem is that it covers so much information, it's hard to get specific information for a specific type home."
"One of the funniest movie's,with the beutifull Sharon Tate: I laughed like hell at some parts of this film.Roman Polanski's a fantastic Actor,as well as being a great director.Sharon Tate is beutifull,even though she doesn't have a big part.I don't have this tape,but remember seeing it years ago on TV.I'm going to order ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" today."
FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS: WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL ME AND MY SISTERS WOULD WATCH THIS MOVIE. UNTIL I SAW THIS SIGHT I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHOEVER KNEW ABOUT THIS MOVIE. I AM SOOOO.. GLAD I FINALLY FOUND IT. THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAV MOVIES. SHARON TATE WAS FAB ON THIS MOVIE. I LOVED THE PART WHEN EVERYONE COMES OUT OF THE GRAVES FOR THE BALL. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS MOVIE. IF YOU LOVED OLD TIME MOVIES YOU'LL LOVE THIS. YOU WON'T BE SORRY.
"Potter's best effort yet.: This album is simply awesome. It stayed in my CD player for weeks after I got it. The compositions are very original and stunningly crafted. The playing is pristine, and I don't think I've heard Potter sound better.Each track is dedicated to great saxophonists of the past, and each is a fitting tribute. The first four tracks alone are worth the price of the whole album. The whole band steps into the groove, and lays down some ballsy, incredible music.If you could only get one CD this year, I'd probably have to recommend this one."
Terrible product: This iron will drench your clothes. It doesn't know the difference between steam and flood. Awful. It also will shut off and the on light will blink red. Zero explanation for what this means in any manual anywhere. Do not buy this iron.
"Don't buy this iron!: I wish I had read the other reviews before I bought this iron when my old one died. My old iron was a cheap Sunbeam which lasted for years.This is the worst iron I have ever used. This iron will not get wrinkles out, even with the setting as high as it will go and steam on full blast. When ironing the thinnest of fabrics, this iron still leaves wrinkles. The base will not sit properly on the ironing board, so it's always falling over - really hazardous. I haven't had the major leaking problem that others have experienced, but it wouldn't surprise me if that happens next.What's the point of making an iron that can't iron? It's useless, and now I have to buy a new iron, after only having had this one for a couple months."
"awful!: After busting the one i had, i saw this one on sale and decided to take two since it was cheap. just like any reviews i've read bout this iron, just now, i have the same exact problems.it spits out water and give your clothes these water stains and ruins the look. u'd have to look for another pair to wear.the iron is light weight and easy enough to use but the fact that it spits at ur clothes is not kool. i would not recommend this to anyone. if i could choose half a star i would."
broad over view: but abit lacking on knowledge.not enough indepth knowledge and wisdom for me. but none the less useful. more of a quick reference i think.a book more if want a sneek peak at the forex market. easy to read and understand.
"We gringas NEED this music!: Gringas, this music changed me. You will learn to feel the emotion behind complex Latin rhythms and it will not seem foreign to you. Juan Luis writes the perfect music to go with his sensual, creative, and loving poetry. He's also a hip and savvy political analyst! You will want to fall in love with him (but I don't recommend it, cuz youz gots no chance!). If you don't know Spanish, his music is reason enough to learn, but you will love it any which way! YOU NEED THIS MUSIC. Nuff said."

"impact of conversation on growth: As a practicing oncologist I deal with peoples struggles for their life.This is another story about an individual's struggle to take control of their life.In some other reviews of this book I think the readers missed the basic concept. This is not a book that blames parents for their childrens psychological problems, rather it points out the power of conversations and actions on another human beings emotional well being. Especially the power during early childhood when the individual is developing his or her self concept.It should remind us all that the conversations we have about people including ourselves can alter a life. The pivotal point for Dibbs was acceptance of his self expression by a talented psychologist then himself and finally his parents. In the epilogue the letter Dibbs writes points it out beautifully.I recommend it highly for all those interested in the triumph of the human spirit."
"A Must Read: This book was absolutely awesome!!! Once I started reading it I could not put it down until it was finished around 3am. This book is definitely a must read for single females, and men should read this too. I loved this book and will recommend it to family and friends."
"song in the preview of captain corelli's mandolin: this is to Mark and Rosie: the name of the song that you are looking for (played in the preview of this movie but not on the soundtrack album) is ""Tonight and the rest of my life"" by Nina Gordon."
"A wonderful and enchanting cd...: This original score is truly beautiful with soft and lofty melodies that capture your heart and fill it with romance. This is a must-have for anyone who loves scores, and the novel is quite flawless as well. I hope the movie lives up to my high expectations!"
Mislead Also: I didn't go out and purchase the cd yet but as well as Mark.D.Kim I was looking for the song that comes out during the preview because I am getting married and loved the song when I heard it in the movie threaters and was hoping someone could help me find the song so I could play it at my reception. Thank you Mark because if it wasn't for your review I would have made the same mistake and purchase the cd looking for the same song.
"nothing compares to Senseo: While I love this coffee, not sure why it went up on my last order. Hopefully it'll go down or its my cue to find another delicous coffee."
"Great tasting and very easy to make: It doesn't get much simpler than this. All one has to do is put the pod in the Senseo coffee maker, fill it up with water, press the button for one or two cups and, less than two minutes later, you have yourself some great-tasting coffee.The machine itself is not expensive and the pods, while not cheap, aren't very expensive, either.While Senseo is the equivalent of espresso (it looks and tastes strong), the coffee itself will not have you bouncing off the walls. It gives you just the right amount of zing to go about your day.Senseo is definitely worth a try (but, beware, there is the tendency to love this coffee). - Donna Di Giacomo"
"non-delivery: I advised Amazon that I did not receive this package even though the documentation said it was delivered. Amazon said I have to check with my postoffice. My postoffice says I have to file a form, which I did. I am going to advise my credit card company that I will not pay the charge on the bill. I like the senseo coffee pods very much and the Dark Roast are hard to find at my grocery store. That's why I ordered them online.Susan Cohn"
"super convenient: I still like using the Senseo machine and pods. They are super convenient- allowing for just a cup of coffee when I want it and not having to deal with either cooked coffee that has been sitting on the warming tray too long or cold coffee. I use my in the office. It is in a common kitchen area. Several others staff have their own little mini coffee pots and have to do the measuring of how many cups of water and how many scoops of coffee. I just pop in the pop, push the button, and in 90 seconds have a hot cup of fresh coffee.and that is good enough to get started in the morning."
"Great coffee!: Very good coffee. We have gotten rid of our drip coffee maker and only use the senseo. We were always wasting coffee in the drip maker, so this is a great way to use only what we need to. If you like strong coffee, these dark roast pods are great!"
"Jaw Dropper: If you are looking for the Truth, stop here and read this book.This wonderful book will calm the tricky mind and allow you to see life more clearly, more of the way it really is. Very powerful statements throughout the book. I highly recommend it!"
"A great book!: Another Way: Allowing Inner Peace is an inciteful book that appeals universally. Especially useful is the advice of noticing emotions, positive or negative, as energy running through our Inner Peace, and watching these emotions flow without judgment. Always, it is Peace that is present,the white screen on which our movies are shown. The book gives simple advice that allows Inner Peace to become more predominant in our Awareness. And isn't that something everyone wants?"
"A good book on analysis: Although an introductory book, it covers most of the fundaments of analysis. That is, from abstract theory of metric spaces through topological spaces and functional analysis. It ends with a somewhat strange presentation of measure theory, but latter it exposes on a simple manner differentiation facts. This is a different and exiting book directed to the somewhat mature reader but not necessarily an analysis expert.The exercises included are illustrative, but they aren't challenging."
great for the price: but used them once and one of the bits is already starting to round over when I torqued it a bit on my folding knife. For 8 bucks I don't mind buying a few sets for the flexibility but it'd be nice if they were stronger than cardboard
"Land Before Time: The price was reasonable and I was very excited when the movie arrived early. However, it was damaged when I opened it."
"Dinosaur Movie - Maybe for Older Kids: I bought this movie for my 2 1/2 year old for Christmas, because he loves dinosaurs, and I remember loving this movie when I was a kid. I wish I had re-watched it before watching with him, because I think there are some parts that would be a little better waiting until he is older (spoiler - the mom of the Brontosaurus dying, Sarah the Triceratops being really stubborn/mean.) Other than that, the movie is just as I remembered, a cute dinosaur movie for kids."
"wonderful: I have seen this movie many many times now, and it remains among my most favorite movies ever. I even quote it in my everyday conversations!"
"artwork: The striking thing about this animated picture is the paint work. Every detail of this movie is an art itself. I also read a review in which was mentioned that Don Bluth could not match Disney. I just think that the Don Bluth's style is somewhat different then Disney's. In spite of the splendid qualities of the disney movies I prefer to watch Don Bluth's animated movies because they are truely artistic. The colours and warmth are much more intense and the scores are better too. I do not have scores of disney movies but I do have scores of Don Bluth's movies. The 'Secret of Nimh' and 'the Land before time' are unbeatenable. Both the movies and the movie scores are 'must to have'.(By the way, the European version of Secret of Nimh is widescreen)Greetings from the Netherlands"
"Not like the others: Those who like this DVD seem to have fallen in love with the movie years ago when it was first released in theaters.We, on the other hand, first discovered the many sequels and then watched this disappointing original. The problem is that they are nothing alike. The sequels are bright, lively, sing-along affairs. The original is somewhat dark and brooding.If you have a toddler who likes the lively sequels, you can skip this one. Don't let the Spielberg-Lucas names fool you into thinking this will be even better. It's not better, just very differentHow does the movie rate on it's own merits? Enjoyable, if you're not a 2-year old looking for singing dinosaurs. And if you're not, there are still shortcomings. The overall look of the DVD release seems dirty and old. The instrumental score is melodramatic, and the animation is a bit cliche': the kids are lost in a world full of shadows and thorns, shadows and thorns. Yuck!"
"The DVD Stinks, what a WASTE on such a GREAT Movie !: Don't need to add more that others have already said about the feature itself, but the DVD now that's another story.I don't write many reviews, but I felt it my duty to let other buyers know before purchasing this DVD that quality is VERY VERY POOR !!! It's almost unwatchable in my eyes, especially if viewing a LARGE format WS projection system.You were warned, buy it only for the content and not the DVD quality or special features, cuz there isn't any !!!!Signed,Disappointed"
"Special features appropriate for toddlers!: I can live with this dvd being only fullscreen (that is supposedly its OAR) but to call this an Anniversary Edition & provide the worst special features ever on dvd is outrageous. Bluth/Spielberg/Lucas should sue Universal to have there names removed from this atrocity & replaced with Alan Smithee. You know when the first ""special feature"" is ""how to use your remote control"" that this disc was produced for children 1-5 years old. My 7 year old nephews turn their noses up at it. What a great movie. What a HORRID dvd presentation. Do what you like with the 101 sequels but give us a quality dvd of this classic original movie. PLEASE!"
"Great Kid Movie: This is one of my favorite movies from childhood, and my kids like it also. It teaches a good message that you can be friends with those who are different and don't look like you or live like you. The death of Little Foot's mother is sad, but I think it's tastefully done. It's not at all graphic, and death is something that all people must eventually face in their lives, which is why it doesn't bother me. I also like that the characters aren't too sugary sweet, and there is no annoying singing."
"Awsome Movie!: This is one good movie. It's a mini, but it's long, and the best way to watch it is all at once...so make time and see the whole thing at once. The acting is superb (talking about Gerard Butler here). There is no one who could have played Attila better. So anyway...see this movie, it's very entertaining."
"Gorgeous Gerard!: I won't beat around the bush, the ONLY reason I bought this was for the wonderful & gorgeous Mr Gerard Butler. And, boy, was it worth it! He just literally oooozes sex appeal in this!Ok, as an historical piece of drama, you could probably pick holes in it, left, right and centre. And, it's no Gladiator....But if you enjoy it for what it is, plenty of action with the odd bit of romance thrown in, then you're onto a winner in my book."
"Revisionist History Never Looked More Handsome: OK, this was a popular mini-series when it was on TV, but it's all about how good you look in a toga or on a horse. Gerard Butler looks good in/on both. The history is generalized and revised to make Attila a bit more cuddly than he really was, and this is the first movie where Gerry Butler really started to sculp his body for his roles and he looks really good in that toga. When he walks into a Roman bath in one scene, it makes one yearn for an uncut European version. The battle scenes are well done and actors like Tim Curry keep the talent level high in what could have been a really cheesy romp. Attila was a brilliant strategist, just not so devastatingly good looking, and in truth history knows little about him personally. This is fun fantasy and a treat for Gerry Butler fans and fans of historical fiction."
"Works perfect for 2002-2008 Full-Size Dodge Ram Pickups! No modification or drilling required; Easy installation!: This fit perfectly. I don't know why they have the first picture though. I added a second picture of what the item actually looks like. It should be a little more up close to see the details too. These cost quite a bit at the store. This was a great price on here. I bought from the seller who was the cheapest (they stated the box was rough). Which it was, but the item was in perfect condition. It was for me, and I am just throwing away the box anyways. It fit perfect on my truck, and looks great! There was no modification or drilling required. It was an easy installation over the existing third brake light using original holes. Simply remove screws holding the lens on, add a small amount of silicone in the existing holes to seal out moisture, put your new cover on the old lens, then secure with the original screws. It looks great at night when it is lit up! Love it!"
"Sweet Mollie Malone: Jumpin Jehosephatz, this book completely blew me away. It knocked me right out of my stained shorts. But it. It is the best! I couldn't put it down. It taught me all about the bible and prophesy and the beast and America. I am a true believer. Everybody must read this best seller."
Powerfully Difficult to Swallow: I wanted to put this book down after each paragraph because it was so painfully true and powerful. It was difficult to accept the truth. Mr. Adam's attack on our man made church doctrines was too true for comfort. He is clear about the beast and 666 and the church and Europe. Now I have to rethink my own convictions. This book has had a very big impact on me.
"One of Book of Love's Best: What I like most about Book of Love is their ability to have fun while also maintaining a serious side and their skillful use of an infectious driving beat. Add to that their brilliance as musical artists who write all their own lyrics and help produce their own albums. Lullaby has several of the most poignant and enchanting love, or love lost, songs ever written and produced, and not the typical love songs that wanna make you throw up.""Melt My Heart"" and ""With A Little Love"" convey the excitement & turmoil caused by a new love. ""Sea of Tranquility"" is a haunting awareness of love lost and a yearning to hold onto it. ""You Look Through Me"" vividly portrays the pain felt after the realization of settling for someone who was never really there to begin with. ""Witchcraft"", hands down, is one of the most fun and charming love songs ever conjured up. But the most remarkable song is a compelling and heartbreaking tribute to a loved one that has passed on--""Lullaby""."
"Overrated with a capital O: Sorry, but this album is one of the most overrated albums ever! There is nothing to get excited about with this album. The best word to describe it is ""boring"". I'm not sure how it gets put up there on some lists of ""the best albums of the 90's"". I not a huge U2 fan, but this album is nothing compared to Joshua Tree and War."
"Well done album: It's tough for me to say which is a better U2 album, achtung baby or joshua tree though they are quite different. I got this album back in 93 and it still sound great to this day, so it's great to here an album that has lasted so long. My tastes have changed quite a bit since then so it amazing that I like some of the same music from that period of my life. Highlights of the album include Mysterious Ways, one, zoo station, and until the end of the world."
This is one of their best CD's: Every song on this album is good. I am a big U2 fan and this is my favorite album.
"Not so good: This is probably the worst book in the series. There is not much going on. The plot did not advance at all from the previous book and to think I waited two years for this book. The only important part is the prologue which is like the continuation of the Book 9, _Winter's Heart_. Do not buy this book. Just borrow it from a library if you really want to know what happens. At least you can return it without delay"
Boring.: What happened with this book? From the 1st book till the 9th it was really good but here there's rarely any action at all. I was expecting better from this series.
"Crossroads of Twilight: SLOW!.... Slow!.... Slooooooow! Absolutely no action in this installment. Dialogue, Dialogue, Dialogue. A complete and total waste of time. If you are trying to get to the final battle and haven't made it to book 10, just skip it! There is nothing in this book that is at all relevent to the story line... and you will save yourself time, frustration and you will probably get to find out about the final battle (unlike myself who just decided that if the author decided to put me thru this agony, I certainly wasn't going to submit myself to any more of it). Let me know how it turns out. If you're listening Amazon, I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
"Filler, pure 100% filler: If you're looking for a book with magic, action and adventure then keep looking. If you're interested in a book where women spend a lot of time either smoothing or twitching their skirts, being either red faced or stone faced then this is the book for you. Jordan peaked at book 3 and frankly anything after book 5 is not worth reading. If you're a Jordan fan then save your money and get it out of the library. If you're not a Jordan fan then don't bother reading this book because nothing happens. You can go from book 9 to book 11 without missing a thing. The only reason this book was 680 pages long instead of 60 was so Bob could bank another cheque instead of actually writing a true fantasy novel. This is not good fantasy don't let anyone convince you otherwise. Read Guy Gavriel Kay's ""Fionavar Tapestry"" trilogy instead."
"Crossroads of Twilight: If you had more money than what you need, or less than there is enough and is contemplating buying this book ... i would strongly suggest to donate your hard earned money away.If the whole WOT series is a journey of a thousand miles, this basically puts you about 3 steps away from Book 9. I am into character building .. but really ... to this detail?The first 5 books was great, the next 4 was tolerable ... but Book 10 ..."
"If you must read it, get it at the library.: Many, many reviewers have already lamented CoT's lack of plot development and bad writing, so I won't beat that horse. I started this series when I was a young teenager, and I loved the first few books. They were engaging, things happened, and it was a satisfying reading experience.I'm past thirty now. My tastes have changed, but I still hold dear the fantasy genre even though I'm now well past the target demographic of pimply, slightly overweight gamers pulling all-nighters hopped up on soda and cheap pizza. My advice to those young elven rangers and giant-killing dwarves out there is to save your money on this series. Get the Wheel of Time series at your local library and buy different books from amazon, books that are worth the money. If we stop buying Jordan's schlock, maybe he (or his editors) will grab a clue, buckle down, and end this increasingly irrelevant tale."
"a boycott: We all agree that CoT was a terrible book. But we all know the second book 11 comes out we'll pay the $25 and buy it. Well, here's a crazy idea. Don't! Sure, we want to know what happens, but that's what libraries are for. Until RJ starts to feel the burn in his wallet he's got no reason to improve the quality of the drek he's been spewing for the last 1600 pages."
"many wasted hours i'll never get back: This series could have been great. It's worthless drivel at this point. The reasons have been given a thousand times already, so I won't repeat them. Don't buy it. Go check our George R.R. Martin's 'Song of Ice and Fire' series instead for a real fantasy saga."
"Very very very slow ...: And very very disappointing. I don't know. In Winter's Heart, it seemed like the pace was being picked up a little bit (after two really slow books)and a couple of momentous things actually happened. Can someone tell me what actually happened in ""Crossroads""? This whole series has turned into a soap opera, except that Jordan's production rate would disqualify him from working on any show.Seriously, how could it possibly take more than two years to produce this drivel? At least, if the quality of the writing is going to be this bad, Jordan should give us a book every six months!Finish the story already dammit!"
"A whole lot of NOTHING: That's what you'll get. Well, you'll get a lot of nattering, tight-lipped, skirt-smoothing, whining Aes Seda, pages of mundane information, and even more splintered sub-plot lines and new characters. But hey, you've been getting that for the last umpteen books. Cripes, why do I keep reading this series? Because with each new book there's still a glimmer of hope that it will GO SOMEWHERE. But, as with the last few books it goes NOWHERE and it doesn't even get there fast. I *never* skip paragraphs when reading a book for the first time but I found myself skipping page after page in this snail fest. This is the worst so far. Mr. Jordan... it is becoming ever obvious that you are milking this. Just finish it for crying out loud. Please end the misery for us all."
"The Prologue: Before I read this book, i was thinking about how the prologues in each of the WOT books seems longer than the book before... Then I read this one, a book where the prologue should be entirely deleted and the rest of the book would serve as one. While the story had not advanced significantly in this series in some time, that was fine with me because things were happening in the world that were interesting. Crossroads of Twilight, however, contains virtually nothing that contributes to the world, no events of note until the last page. Filler I can take. This book was sub-par filler."
"God it hurts...: The first 5 or 6 books of this series is great. They are fast, characters are developing and there is lots of new stuff to see and learn about.Ever since then it has been very very very slow. The characters and people haven't changed. All I read about it is what everyone is thinking all the time, I have heard it again and again. I know how everyone thinks. All the woman are the same, all Aes Sedai are the same, everyone's thoughts are the same! Nothing changes! 10 books of this, we don't need anymore character insight, we need action. Give us some good hardcore battles, more the story along, tie up loose ends. Quit writing about stuff we already know and have heard about, after 6 books you can ease back on the same old stuff, we get it! This book is filler. It's so painfully obvious this book and the few before it were just written to extend the series and make money as it offers almost nothing new.My new favorite author is George RR Martin. Read his stuff, it's excellent!"
"crossroads of twilight: Come on Jordan, quit using us..this book has taken somthing brillant and run it into the dirt..reading it was like being trapped by a boor at a cocktail party. Shame on you."
"Once again, Nothing Happens: The first 3 to 4 books in this series were thoroughly enjoyable. The characters were consistent and the reader could keep track of them. The rest of the series has been nothing but an almost constant stream of new, and uninteresting characters, with no significant plot events. This book follows in the same vein. It takes over 400 pages to even reach the point where the 9th book leaves off. And absoluelty nothing happens. If the 11th book fails to further the plot, I will no longer read Robert Jordan. I'm tired of the same scene involving a bunch of petty, bitchy, women arguing...over and over..."
Give us our money back!: This was junk. I have been a devoted Jordan fan since 1995. I've told all my freinds how great the series is and what an exceptional writer Robert Jordan is. I never thought Robert would make me out to be a lier. I just don't get it. Did he forget what a sword and fantasy novel is? How does he publish a book that has no action in it whatsoever? My advice to Jordan is try agian. It has occured to me that he's prolonging this series to get money. And I would hope that no author would go this low to solicite money. If he need $ he could of just asked for donations. That way there wouldn't be extra space in my closet taken up with this poor excuse for a fantasy novel.Some would say that he's just trying to fulfill his vision of a fantasy novel much the same way George Lucas makes Star Wars- for himsef first and the public second. In which case I say fine. Just give us our money back robert! That way we don't feel so cheated.
"A Quick Analogy: Once I ate a BBQ Pork sandwich, and boy it was really good. So good that I ate another one, and another and another. Finally after ten of the same BBQ Pork sandwiches they didn't taste quite as good. That doesn't mean it was bad, it just was not as good as the first one. I'm really not sure what the cook is doing in the back but next time I come to eat I may just order something else."
"2 years' wait for ... nothing?: One star is being generous.I found the last book moderately entertaining, and looked forward to the next one. Six hundred pages, and the main character appears in approximately 12 of those. Nothing happens, nothing is resolved, nothing changes - an entire book of childish women whining about how stupid men are, and childish men whining about how controlling women are - a candid view of Mr. Jordan's obsessions I could well have done without. The author should spend some of the money he has bilked from his readers and get some therapy instead of shoving his relationship problems down those readers' throats.I don't care how good the hype gets for his next book - I am finished with this lame duck."
"Terribly diappointing: If you're looking for a continuation of the action from the first nine books, don't bother reading this one. Basically, it reacts to the event which ended the 9th book and advances the story only slightly. I was very disappointed! It seems that Mr. Jordan does not know how to end the story and is only selling books at this point."
"Don't look, don't buy and (for God's sake) DON'T READ IT!: I don't have to go into much detail here - I can't say much that is different from the other hundreds of negative reviews already listed on this website. What I can say is that I am not buying anymore of Mr. Jordan's books. I was 21 back when I started reading this ""epic"" series - I'm now 34 and there is no end in sight. Mr. Jordan's longwinded style of prose, nauseating attention to detail and lack of any direction have now killed any future interest in these books that I may have ever had. Please take my advice and that of all of the other readers - avoid these books! Life is too short and the fantasy world is filled with much better authors than this one."
"Six hundred pages of.....nothing.: Well. I'd say it's about time to give Jordan a round of applause. He has managed to do what few even come close to---write a full length fantasy novel and have -nothing- happen, and have -none- of the plotlines resolved, or even being -close- to being resolved!The repititions are grating on the nerves, the pages spent describing how to launder silk (among other things) are unbearable, and the lack of PLOT is appalling. Did I mention that I was falling asleep trying to push my way through the first four hundred pages, hoping against hope that something, ANYTHING would happen. Nope. And then it just ends, and it's like you're staring at the book like ""Oh my God this book is beyond horrible""Please, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK. If you -must- read it get it from the libary. But honestly you can just skip it. I know I'm never buying a hardcover Wheel of Time book again."
"Robert Jordan is a horrible horrible person: Before I read this book I never realized how little a person could say in SO MANY words. Almost 700 pages of NOTHING. We waited how long for this piece of [junk]? If he wants to stop the series he should just stop it, but don't kill us with boredom. This book even surpasses the nothingness of book 5. There is more nothing in here than ever before. Do not read this book, do not buy this book. It's like War & Peace on Valium. Go see a movie or something. Or you could switch to the Terry Goodkind series which is quite similar but far more cool since stuff actually happens. I am writing this so that you don't have to suffer as I have suffered."
"Show about nothing = funny. Book about nothing = joke on me: No one moves. there is an amazing artform developing here, for the lovers of null, inertia, stasis, nada, zip, nothing. No one in the entire almost 1000 pages actually does anything or goes anywhere. At least in the previous book (which was pretty close to stasis) some things occured to move the story along.There is one wonder and joy in book 10 of this series. Not reading book 10 in the series will leave you in exactly the same place starting book 11 as reading book 9 in the series left you. You wont have missed a single thing, and if by chance some detail or another *was* missed, you wont know it, because it had no consequence whatsoever.So if you have read 1 through 9, just skip 10 and go right to 11 when it comes out. After reading a few reviews to see if it was necessary to read either.my brief synopsis of events in book 10:and there you have it."
"I waited two years for this?!?: It's official. The magic is gone. There was once a time when I couldn't put down an Eye of the World volume. Now, I can't wait for them to end.For those interested in purchasing Book 10 -- visit a bookstore and read the hardcover jacket. You'll get all of what happens in COT there, plus a couple mentions of things that don't.Lemme see... Mat moves about 30 miles up the road from where we last saw him. Perrin chases the Shaido a bit, stops to replenish his food supply, and frets about Faile. Elayne meets with a couple teenagers to gain their support for her bid for the Lion Throne. Rand does nothing. Egwene plots about how to retake the White Tower, and then is ridiculously captured.And that's it. Folks, it's getting ugly out there."
Absolutely Nothing: Nothing happens? Absolutely nothing! 680 pages and the characters do nothing. Oh wait...you do get a bunch of tertiary new characters who do nothing but confuse. Jordan has said on NUMEROUS occasions he knows what the last scene is in this series. I begin to believe he doesn't know how to get there.
"Shame on RJ: WOT was/is a good series. Now, RJ is just milking his fans for money. I spend [money] for a book. I expect some entertainment. So why was I grinding teeth the whole time I read it?There was no action. The story didn't advance. This book was boring, and uninspiring. Heck, he didn't even throw us a bone at the end of the book as usual. You probably can skip number ten and go trait to number 11 and not miss a thing.The sorry part is he know we'll just keep on buying his books because we want to see the end of it. RJ need to listen to the majority of his fans here. They are the one who made him."
"Don't Bother: Since his terrific start in this series Jordan has generally gone downhill with the plot dragging on and on. In volume nine, however, he did recapture some of his storytelling abilities and, with his normal style, provided a huge and exciting finish. His latest endeavor, however, fails to move the plot along to any reasonable degree. The situation with Perrin and Faile has hardly changed. Ditto for Elayne. The Mat and Tuon relationship could have been handled in a few paragraphs, Rand is almost missing from this volume, and the marvelous feat accomplished by Rand and Nynaeve in volume nine was hardly even recognized. If this work were condensed into about two to three chapters it might be a good start for a book."
"This is the worst one yet: I can't believe that some people claim this book is the the best one yet. This book just proves that Jordan doesn't know how to tell a story.BUILD to a climax, please., Mr. Jordan.This is nothing more than a soap opera. A bad one, at that."
"Stout wool, fine silk, and dressmaking...again.: If you hate action and want to learn more about the cut of a dress, then this book is for you. After struggling with action, fighting, and a plot at the first of this series RJ has finely come into his own with even more detailed detail. I can now spot good stout wool from across the room."
"I have to agree...: I have been the most ardent of fans and unlike most Shadow Rising adherents I feel that the Lord of Chaos is the pinnacle of the series. This book however, like the last two, is an extremely boring disappointment. There is no direction and it is obvious Jordan has lost control of the story. So many characters have simply disappeared that I have lost count; not to mention the fact that the prologue seems to be a prologue for book eleven more than book ten. The one redeeming part of the book was Mats story which of course was without any kind of character or plot arc, but at least he is entertaining. There are so many questions about who is where and what I am actually angry at this book. I am of course going to keep buying the books though. ..."
"What a colossal waste ...: of time and money. I have read the first four books many times, the next three a few times but I shudder at the thought of opening COT again. It was so boring that I couldn't finish it.Do yourself a favor if you have to read it and go to the Library - I know they will have one since I will be donating my copy to them."
"Absolutely BORING: The reason I became hooked on this series was because of the great characters (Rand, Mat, and Perrin) the complex plot twists, great writing, and the epic battles against evil. All, save great writing, have been absent from this book. I am tired of hearing about Aes Sedai and their petty differences. Get on to the siege of Tar Valon. There was no need to get so in depth and detailed with this aspect of the story. I, along with most readers would rather hear about how Rand is after his cleansing of Saidin, how Mat is doing, or Perrin's trek to rescue his wife. You can only take so much of Aes Sedai whining."
"The worst yet: This is definately the worst of the series so far. I agree that you could easily skip this book altogether. This book frustrated me to no end in that all storylines carried over from the last book were left unresolved and the only progression is that we now understand the different characters intentions. It is not enough to simply learn a few details while you read 600 some odd pages of dialogue and observations while the plot of the characters I have grown to love did not advance at all. At all! I just cant understand how Robert Jordan could let this go to publish. I have to remind myself when reading this that this is the same guy who wrote Eye of the World, Great Hunt, and Dragon Reborn which in my opinion standing by themselves comprises one of the greatest fantasy epics ever written. Unfortunately Jordan has hit rock bottom with this latest installment."
"Save your money and your time: I'll keep this brief, as opposed to the ponderous tome in review. You could completely skip this book and not miss anything. I give the book 2 stars only out of respect for the first 7 books that I felt were worth the time and money. Unfortunately I now, along with the rest of you, must wait who knows how long for the 11th book to be produced. Until then, I eagerly await George R R Martin's fourth book in the ""Song of Fire and Ice"" series."
Rand first shows up on page 544: Horrible book. Robert Jordan should be embarrassed. The other reviews state this. I must say it have made me feel better reading them. I am so happy that this got a 1.5 star rating.But I'd like to add that the editors of this book should be embarrassed also. There are multiple transitions in the book that just don't make sense or are confusing because RJ hasn't given enough details on what is going on (because he's too busy describing what each person is wearing).Shame on the publishers for putting this book out and shame on RJ. RJ must have contracted Alzheimers because his books have deteriorated horribly. You suck RJ.
"Please, please finish!: I have struggled through this book only because of stubborness and determination. It goes nowhere, addresses nothing, has no action and resolves nothing! For slow reading and lack of interest, I would definitely rate it a 5.I will wait for the reviews before I buy another book in this series. Perhaps it would be best to save your money and not buy Crossroads. Just skip to Book 11 (assuming that it is somewhat better)."
"Just shoot me now. . .: Robert Jordan has accomplished something no other writer has ever done before - turned me off of a series before I finished it. It no longer matters to me if there are 2 more books, 5 more, or 100 more. I have kicked the habit!A phone book has fewer characters to keep straight and a more interesting plot."
"unfortunate: Mr. Jordan your story has become unfortunate. The Crossroads of Twilight was the worst book that I've ever read and I regret beginning what was once a fascinating story. I will not slog through anymore of your tedious and infinitely repetitive depictions of icy Aes Sedai serenity, women wearing scandalous breeches, plunging necklines, and ridiculous bickering."
"How to meta game Wheel Of Time Series into a Choose your own adventure: The best way to enjoy this series is to read up to book 4 then stop. In your mind at that point is contained all the magic and cool adventures that could possibly happen to the 3 friends who leave a small village and set off for adventure. If however, you were not able to do that and have ended up at this point of the series where there are 100 characters who have all become exactly the same and unidentifiable fear not!* The first thing you must do is place all your Robert Jordan books on one big shelf* Obtain different coloured paper* Buy some foldersThen simply begin to create a database of each character and colour code each of group, that way whenever you are reading the books and have no idea who has gotten to which point simply go to your easy file system and quickly check as to who you're person is and why you should care how their clothing effects their social status."
"Worst book of the series: A brief insight into what was going through Jordans head while writing this would be something like ""Blah, blah, blah, Daddy needs a new house, blah, blah, blah"". I was extremely disappointed in the lastest book as nothing happens. Even the cliff hanger ending was boring. Its becoming increasingly obvious to me that Jordan and his publishers know they have an instant best-seller so they don't care whether or not it's actually good. If the next book is as big a piece of verbal diarhea as this one, I won't care how the storey ends."
"What they said...: Yes, this is just a dreadful book. I didn't read any reviews before I slogged through COT, then I laughed at the universal loathing. What can I say that hasn't been said?I can say that Robert Jordan can bring his fans back with one blazing, fantastic book that ties the threads together and completes the once-epic Wheel of Time series. I'm hanging on and hoping."
"It's just too bad...: I held off reviewing this because I think the other reviewers to date pretty much have it nailed down. Yes, nothing of real significance plot-wise happens in this entire (lengthy) novel. Yes, the character development and description presented here seem to indicate that Jordan is just filling pages. The other books in the series are pretty solid, this one is sort of the black sheep of the lot.That said, the real tragedy and disappointment here is that the late Robert Jordan never finished his final book in the series. All is not lost- he did apparently dictate the plot he intended to write, but he didn't get to do it himself.I can't help but wonder how much better that book would be if Jordan had just skipped Crossroads, and spent his precious time writing the finale instead."
"average customer reviews ---- 1.5 stars.(over 1300 reviews!): Possibly achieveing the lowest score on amazon ever, this book has downright defined how bad an author can write a story. While I love hearing about Rand's brown shirt over the course of 687 pages, there is no plot.Jordan just writes now to make money. He doesn't care at all about his readers. He decided to write about what appeals to him, and what appeals to him is ""fashion designer"".I have never read a book so terrible. This book is crap. You could skip this book and be fine in book 11 probably, because nothing happens."
"This would be funny if it weren't so sad: Note to RJ: You already killed the cow, you can stop trying to milk her now.Note to prospective readers: Buy something by George R R Martin instead."
The Series that just won't die ...: This series is going absolutely no where in a hurry. The author has so many minor character story lines still going its ridiculous. What started out as a series that moved ... kept you engaged has turned into a crawl the last several novels.Did he change editors?Read something else ... maybe the rest of the series will quietly die or show up for free at a half-finished unreadable rummage sale by 2025.
"RJ - please start paying attention to your fans!: Up until a couple of days ago, I thought I was a diehard WoT fan. Sure the last few books have been a little bit slower, but there has been something interesting or exciting happening in all of them. The last book ended with one of the most momentous developments in the entire series....but it was barely addressed in this book! Almost nothing happened in this book. No single storyline was even close to resolved. Rand had about 20-40 pages in the entire book and that didn't even come until past the five hundred page mark. I'm sure that Robert Jordan is doing exactly what he wants to with this series, and that's fine. It's HIS series. But after this book, a think that there will be a lot of fans who no longer have the patience or the desire to follow him in what has become a long-winded, irrelevant hollow shell of what could have been a great saga."
"I'm Done: Mr. Jordan has taken character and plot development to a new level...total boredom. I just read in one reader review that he, Jordan, said that he is writing for himself. Good for you Robert, another innovation in literature...well more like commercial writing, the author doesn't care what his readers think. I suppose that's fair. After reading this book I realized that I no longer care what happens... so I made up my own ending. At the current rate not many of us will survive to read the ending anyway. Actually I'm beginning to think that it would be more fun if the Dark One and his Darkfriends win in the end."
crossroads of twilight: This is one of the best installment in robert jordans series. The prot becomes intricate and more interesting as the series draws closer towards tai'mon Gaidon in which rand al'thor has to fight the dark one in order to save the world. Any who think this a slow book must be pretty boring people who are very hard to please!
"Time to give up on the series: Too many minor characters to keep track of, and nothing much happens in this book. I am giving up on the whole series and moving on to authors who are better writers and know how to keep a story going. Robert Jordan will waste no more of my time!"
"Doesn't deserve even 1 star!!!: I refuse to buy anymore of Jordan's books until he finishes the series with some decent books with action and more story than describing characters, clothing and locations with hundreds of pages of text."
"Dull, Duller, Dullest: When you are 6,800 pages into a series its hard to just give up and stop reading becuase the series is moving so slowly. However this is what ive finally done. The main character Rand is only in 20 pages of the 680. All the other pages are dull, without action, and involve only secondary plots. I actually returned the book I was so discusted with it."
"Why is this series so addictive?: It's like the taint on Saidin. You keep turning pages, despite being sickened by the foulness, the bilgewater prose, the repetition, the sheer idiocy of it all.I swear Jordan must be trying to set a couple of records here. Aside from the ""Longest Novel Ever Written"" record he would appear to be aiming at achieving some level of superlative with regard to slowness of exposition. The first 350 pages of this book take place prior to, or simultaneous with, the events described in the last chapter of the previous book. That is, half of this nearly 700-page long book, doesn't manage to move the overall plot's timeline foreward by even a single day."
"Time to redeem yourself Mr Jordan: I'm afraid that like many readers of The Wheel of Time series, I have come to the aptly named crossroads, i.e. do I really care what happens to the characters anymore? The first few books were excellent, but Mr Jordan appears to have lost the plot. We have a comedy series on TV in the UK called Little Britain, in which one of the characters is an author who tries desparately to pad out her stories in order to write enough pages for a book. Her catch phrase is ""How many pages now Audrey?"", to which her trancriber invariably comes back with a figure of 10. Could Mr Jordan be having similar difficulties? I feel there could be a positive side to this if Mr Jordan is aware of the reviews his books are receiving... It's not too late to provide a cracking book or two and end the series to acclaim, in the same way it started."
"Robert Jordan drags out another: It's a shame... once again, Robert Jordan shows his talent for drawing the series out even further, giving the story more twists and complications when he should be resolving the 4,009 plots he's already introduced. C'mon, RJ, how much more involved can you make this? The Wheel of Time puts soap operas to shame for the sheer drag-it-out factor.It wouldn't be so bad if the time between books was decreasing. But instead, fans waited two years and three months for this last book... as opposed to the *mere* two years they waited for the previous book. How long will he make us wait for another book that complicates the plot even further? My grandkids will no doubt father children who will be wondering when the series will end.Boo to Robert Jordan. He's become a money-hungry, greedy writer with more concern for his own pocket than his fans. His books no longer provide satisfying content and just plain take too long to produce.This will be the last of his series that I read."
"ARGH=>never pre-order ZERO STARS!!!!!: I made the mistake of pre-ordering this book. Never again, never. I totally agree with most of the reviews except one, i no longer have hope this series will go anywhere=>no hope. there is a term that discribes this book BORING, SPACE KEEPER, CONTRACT FULFILMENT."
"Much Ado About nothing: Well I finally ended reading Jordan's 10th torment. I have to say it was not as bad as I thought it might be but sure hell could have skipped a few chapters and get to the good stuff which apparently takes place in the last ..20 pages? Cmon, it is time for this series to end, unfortunately marketing is a wonderful business; I do hope that book 11 picks up the pace to a very satisfying conclusion. We deserve it MR JORDAN!!!! Let the final battle begin!!!"
"Disappointing: After 2+ years since the last, I was practically salivating for this book to come out. Like many fans of W.O.T., I reread the whole series to prep for the release of ""C.o.T."" And what we've ended up with is a book, the contents of which could have been summarized in a forward. There is virtually no movement in any of the storylines. There are far too many pages describing the outfits that everyone is wearing. The first 2/3 of the book takes place at the same time as the last 1/3 of the last book. Mr. Jordan, some resolution please."
"Well, we know they'll never make a movie out of it: I found that the best thing to do with this volume was to simply read the dialog and skip all the rest. That way you can finish it in a day, still know everything you need to know to continue the series and not waste a lot of your life in tedium and frustration."
"Dreadful: It's awful of course. Draggy and very slooowww. One suggestion for those of us who are stuck in the series. Don't read the book in chapter order. Skip around and only read about the characters who interest you. If Elayne bores you to tears and you find a section on her, skip it. That way you can get to the end with less pain.If you haven't started the series, don't! This is worse than book nine and frequently unreadable."
"Complete stall in action and hanging on unimportant details: The saddest part is that I have had to defend Mr. Jordan for three books now with the friends I got addicted to the 'Wheel of Time'. Now Mr. Jordan has written one that I cannot defend. Absolutely nothing happens in this book. More unimportant characters are described in lavish detail. The only two items of interest are that both camps of Aes Sedai are entertaining alliances with the Black Tower and Egwene ends up captured by Tower Sisters. Other than that, you could skip this book entirely."
"Worst book in series: Dear Tor,Please send me a voucher for those hours I lost reading Crossroads of Twilight. I would to have them back please.This is hands down the most boring and tedious book in this series. Even though I have all ten of them in hardback, I stop here and give up on this mess.I encourage you to ...write to the editors letting them know how you feel!"
"Long wait. Little worth.: After reading through chapter after chapter of useless detail that failed to progress the plot, I was expecting something major to happen with Rand at the end to make it all worth it. What a disappointment! What a waste of money. I should have waited to buy this one used for 4 or 5 dollars. I thought book 9 was short on substance, but book 10 makes it look great!"
"marketing case study: Crossroads is a miserable book. Just awful. There is no follow up to Rand's supposed cleansing of the source or anything that the series was originally about. Jordan, for whatever bizarre reasons of his own, chooses to focus on the absolute worst storyline in the series: the once likeable Perrin and his tiresome wench Faile. The Mat backstory barely redeems the book, because it takes 200+ pages to tell what should have taken 20.It is eerie how checked out the editors at TOR are. Have they, like, not read the last 4 books, much less edited them? I think this series is a case study in marketing a fading brand -- when quality fails you fall back and cannibalize your loyal customer base with new, similar products. ..."
"Absolutely Terrible: Please do your self a favor and avoid this series like the plague. When I start a series, and I've been inthis genre for years, I finsih it. This is the first one I really wanted to quit. I really beieive the author fills the books with mindless babble just to fill 800 pages and sell something. Book 10 is the worst of a really bad series. Read the dictionary, it has more life."
"The thing that sucks the MOST...: Is how much retarded emotional investment has been put into these friggin' characters. Goddamn, i started reading this series when i was 14, and i'm still sitting here at 24 reading this awful mess. Unfortunately, you fall in love with the characters, the world, and the setting, and you can't get all that crap out of your head.And hell, i'm a rational human being! A medical student! Some day i'll be messing with your body, but even then it'll be nowhere near the mindjob that Jordan has crapped all over us. Obviously, we've all got better things to do, but once in a while you just get pissed off that you care about something so utterly stupid.Read this book if you have to. I know i did, but man... what a price to pay."
Zero plot advancement: I concur with the other reviewers. Nothing happens in this book. Save yourself some money and skip from #9 to #11 with the assurance that you're missing nothing. Robert Jordan's editor needs to have words with him.
"Yadda, Yadda, Yadda: I agree with all the others who have stated that everything important that happened in this book could be summarized in one concise paragraph.I think Jordan has collapsed under the weight of the mass of characters and plotlines he has created. I was hoping by some Herculean effort, he could resolve something in this book, move forward, bring something to a head. I was wrong."
Nothing Happens!: This book was egarly awaited and is such a let down because there is no furthering of plot or action of any kind! I'm trying to decided if Jordan has a reason for this torment or if he is truly as baffeled as we the readers by the recent events of his series.
"Worse book I have ever read: I love attention to detail and a complexed book or series. The first 5 books in this series are fantastic. The next 4 were not as good, but still I enjoyed them. I even enjoyed book 9 and thought many critics were a bit hard. I'm sure my enjoying book 9 more than most is because I do enjoy suspense being built even if it is at a slower pace than most would wish for.With all that said, book 10 is the worse book I have ever read in my life. I can not say enough horrible things about it. Imagine the worse book you have ever read, times that by 10, and then hope you are lucky enough to read that book instead of book 10."
"SKIP IT!: While I love the series, this book is an absolute waste of time and money. Save your money for a series where something is actually happening and you don't finish several hours worth of reading feeling like you just got ripped off. Anyone who read Winter's Heart will have no trouble with Book 10...assuming it actually has a plot."
"I hate to be negative but...: I am a WOT fan. I have enjoyed this series, even through a couple of less...enjoyable...books. However, I am afraid I have to join my voice to all the others who have bashed this instance of the series. .... Pure and simple.First of all, the first 300 pages should have been in the previous book. I don't mind a flashback to the previous book in the prologue (like those experienced in previous books) but 300 pages worth of it? Get serious.Halfway through the book, we finally start reading material that would fit into the new book and, aside from some mediocre advances in the Matt/Perrin plots, nothing.Don't get me wrong. The writing is still top notch but the plot just does not cut it.Tor and Jordan better not make us wait another two years for the new book. If they do, Tor is better start looking for a new editor."
"When is the story going to progress?: Like many, I get the feeling that Jordan is either stringing this out for all its worth or he has run dry. I cannot otherwise explain the unbelievably slow pace of the last four books.The content of this book could easily have been covered properly in two or three chapters - it did not require an entire book to cover the progress that was made (if any) in Crossroads.While I understand Jordan's political expertise, I do not want to be subjected to it except at my own choice.Can I suggest that Jordan concentrate a bit more on what his readers want rather than self-gratification. And could the publisher please take note of what the readers in ever-increasing numbers are saying !!"
It just keeps getting worse: I give high praise to Robert Jordan for his early books in the Wheel of Time series. Unfortunately his later books keep getting progressively worse.Don't even bother reading Crossroads of Twilight. Nothing happens. It is actually pretty amazing that Jordan can fill so many pages in a book and still not advance the plot.I'm finished reading his books. I might pick them up again if he ever finishes the series but I'm done waiting to the next installment in his saga.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!
"Where is the plot?: Another reviewer summed it up pretty nicely: Robert Jordan must be paid by the word. There's no other explanation for this book. The story simply does not develop from Winter's Heart. The progress of the story could be summed up in one to two rather short sentences, at most. Robert Jordan has always inserted lengthy descriptions of various persons, landscapes or whatever, but in the previous books I didn't mind because there was also something going on. I guess the pain that other reviewers felt during reading Crossroads really comes from lengthy descriptions without anything really happening. It's simply boring! Nevertheless, I am waiting for the next book in the hope of something new."
"As usual, a slow paced book: A turtle, swimming in a sea of peanut butter, would be faster than this.This has got to be the slowest Robert Jordan book ever. I can't believe why there is the need to describe one scene using two to three (sometimes more) pages. Probably, if you took out all the unnecessary details, you'd be left with about 200 to 300 pages, or even less, and still get the same idea. The only thing that makes me continue reading this series is that I've already read Books 1-9 which, for the most part, I enjoyed. I hope his style changes in Book 11, although I'll most certainly read that also whatever happens, if only just to finish the series (coz the storyline is really good)."
795 pages of filler: I understand that when writing a series there is some pressure from the publisher to get the next one out.I have read literally hundreds of fantasy novels and this rates as the worst one to date. I love the Wheel of time series but have never read a book that spent so much time describing the minuture of meaningless detail that fills at least half of the pages of this book.If you are looking for anything about the central character Rand then expect to see about four pages worth. This book could have easily been condensed into two chapters and filled out with a lot more interesting writing. You could skip this book and probably not notice it when book eleven comes out.
"Modern Novel Marketing 101: First off, let me say I'm a fan of Jordan and will most likely (or unfortunately) have to read everything else he writes in this series. Like everyone else, I'm hooked. I just hope, by the grace of God, that he stays with us long enough to finally finish this story!What he's doing here is classic fantasy novel marketing. Write some incredible first few books in a series, masterfully develop great characters, then drag it out for as many volumes as possible and for maximum profit. How else can it be explained? He's got this process down, and he and his publisher are laughing all the way to the bank!Okay, now bring on Book 11. I can't wait!!"
"ROBOT Jordan vs. The Sims: After reading this lackluster installment of what was once my favorite fantasy series. I think that the rumours are true about the author's self destructive life style. He has obviously lost a large number of neural pathways and has burned out his brain.This book was written by ROBOT Jordan. He is obviously on cruise control and living in some kind of artificial simulated reality where writing is a program and text is reproduced according to alogrithm. I think TOR needs to step in and have a real live author help pull his strings for him.. Kind of like what Geppeto did for Pinnochio. Better yet bring in a faith healer or an exorcist. All I know is that Jordan is going to need some major mojo or voodoo to re-animate his ""cold dead hands""....Hopefully it will happen soon or else all we'll be left with is a pile of dust and a test pattern...."
"Thank goodness for libraries: (with apologies to Winston Churchill)Never in the history of Fantasy novels have so few (Jordan), written so much (this book) and achieved so little (plot advancement).The guy is just in it for the money. I'm glad I got it from the library. If you want engrossing fantasy, try Stephen Erikson."
"I'm Convinced--the series now stinks: Yes, the book is a disgraceful mess. Authors are notoriously self-indulgent at times, but Jordan really seems to have gone off the deep end here. His publisher must be terrified that everyone will catch on (the plot has become ""let's make more money and string the readers along as long as possible"") and bail out. Fortunately, [others] seem to realize, all too well, that the fix is on and this book is an insult to all of the WoT's faithful fans. That so many reviews have misspellings and grammical errors shows to me that they were written in a grip of angry passion about the book's myriad shortcomings and Jordan's inexcusable money-grubbing. Give it up, readers!..."
"From Fantasy to Soap Opera Writer: Well, quite frankly, I am at a loss for words. I can't stop wondering what happened to the writer of the first four books. Generally I am not pessimistic, but I think this series is done. RJ had his chance to redeem himself after the book eight disappointment but really blew it on this one. Would be readers who are looking for a good story should look elsewhere; this is no fantasy story, it is pure soap opera. RJ has taken ""Days of Our Lives"" and converted it to RandLand.NOTHING happened in this book but conversation between unknown characters and far flung plotlines. I think the story has taken a life of its own, and RJ is not in control anymore. I am shocked that TOR let this book get out to the press. Nothing important happened in this book that could not have been written in one chapter.I shall repeat, 680 pages of diologue... if I wanted 680 pages of worthless dialogue I could have turned on CSPAN."
"As slow as it gets: This has to have been one of my favorite series of all time. I couldn't wait for this one to be to show up at more door! How disapointing. Now the Wheel of Time series is a deep story wih lots of detail, and thats what makes it great. But this book, is ALL detail. There isn't one advancement to the storyline. The writing is still as good as ever, but its gotten way to slow. The story the characters find themselves in the beginning of the novel are nearly unchanged throught the story. This one in no way is need to keep up in the series, in fact, this one didn't change anything from book 9, so if you read that one, you are just as cought up with anyone who read this book."
"No action. No progress. Very disappointing: I have eagerly anticipated the release of this book and the opportunity to touch base with the characters and story line that I have been hooked on for years in the hopes that Mr. Jordan would take us back to the heart of the main story and get away from the trends of his recent volumes. However, I read the entire book only to find that NOTHING HAPPENS! This latest edition seems to revolve around the characters reacting to one another with none of the action or provocative events so richly portrayed in the earlier books. The story has lost all focus with new characters and situations begin introduced with no resolutions being offered to the ones that we have been so patiently following. There was a time I would have put Robert Jordan just below Tolkien, with Goodkind and the rest just copy cats of their style, but the last two efforts in the Wheel of Time are making me long for a new Sword of Truth release!"
"If you haven't read it yet, follow these instructions.: 1. Go to bookstore.2. Pick up ""Crossroads"" and turn to page 677 of 680.3. Read from the section break onto the next page.4. Close the book and replace it on the shelf. You have just read the only meaningful action or plot movement in the entire volume.5. Save [$$] by not buying it."
"An Interesting Question: I began reading the Wheel of Time about two years ago. I read straight from the beginning to the end in about two months and loved just about every minute of it. Granted there were parts in the later books that I spaced out through a bit and some of the Nynaeve/Elayne chapters could grate on my nerves, but I didn't have any real problem with those later volumes. I loved Winter's Heart. I've since re-read the series 3 times. Now we have Crossroads of Twilight. It's the first book in the series that I've actually had to wait for. I'm very disappointed. I mean honestly, the biggest event in Perrins story is the purchase of grain? Here's what I find curious though: am I dissapointed because the book is grossly inferior to the others or because I had undue expectations? Maybe I'll just have to re-read the series again with no expectations placed on this book and see how it fits in. Oh well. Maybe the next one won't take so long."
"What an waste!: If you liked the Books 7, 8 and 9, you will love this one. It continues the 'pattern' of 1000 pages of nothing. I am so disappointed and angry I can not write or think clearly. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Mine will be for sale online in 2 minutes. Read the first six, go online and read a synopsis of all since then, and let us hope all the current outrage will force Jordan into putting a knife into this plotline. George R. R. Martin has plainly surpassed Jordan as the best author in the genre."
"Please move the story along.: I have been following ""The Wheel of Time"" series over the years. I have really enjoyed the series until the last few books, and this book the ""Crossroads of Twilight"" has been my biggest disappointment yet.After reading the 665 pages, I conclude that I am growing very weary of pages upon pages of two line descriptions of differing Aes Sedai glaring at each other. I have also lost interest in the many paragraphs of detail going into the lack of weevil infested food Egwene is consuming.The positive points of the story for me were the chapters involving Mat and Tuon's growing relationship and the chapter where Alviarin is marked.I will continue reading the series because I feel so invested in the characters and do very much want to read the outcome of this story. My wish is for ""The Wheel of Time"" to turn a little faster, and to keep with the pacing set in the first few books of this series."
Don't buy the hardcover: Wait until all the books are out before you buy this one. He's milking it for all he's worth at this point.
I've been robbed!: What a bitter disappointment. This series started out so incredibly great and has become so very dreary. Someone else mentioned that we have been waiting for the battle for the White Tower since book 6!! GET TO THE POINT ALREADY!I can appreciate plot development and pulling all the sub-plots together but at least make it entertaining. It took me weeks to read this one because it kept putting me to SLEEP!I'm done with WOT. On a separate note Amazon.com should change the ratings so you can give zero stars.
"Major Diappointment: I have read all of the books in this series and have found the last two to be major disappointments when compared to the first 2 or 3. As one reviewer mentioned, 600 pages and nothing has happened. Quite frankly I couldn't care less how descriptive the dress of any certain individual is. I mean I read half a page to see what the person is wearing, nothing but fluff.To wait 2 years for this book and to read almost 700 pages of fluff. A major diappointment. Jordan says he plans on writing at least 2 more books in this series. The way the action has gone in the last 2 or 3 books, it would take another 10 to get to the fianl battle."
"If I Could Give Negative Stars...: Any movement, character development, action, and entertainment that you found in the previous 9 (well maybe the first 7) books of this series comes to a screeching halt in this book. The plot doesn't move forward, and results in the character development and action completely drying up. This book is, I hope, an introduction to the next book which will hopefully be more than a waste of paper. If books 8 and 9 disappointed you, please don't waste your money on this book. If you must read it, find it at your local library. It seems that Jordan has completely abandoned his characters, the plot, and his fans for several hundred pages of running in circles and politics. This book functions better as a doorstop."
"Ok, so in two years this is what you came up with?: I could of written something like that in 1 year, and I don't know squat. Although my plot line probably wouldn't line up or be as tedious as that.Only read this because, well lets face it, you probably read the first nine and can't wait to see what's going to happen. And nothing did in this book.Lets only hope it doesn't take him another two years for book 11.cause with they way he's going chances are we won't be alive long enough to see this thing through."
Fantastic: Robert Jordan is amazing at creating a world you can become fully immersed in. Never before have a read a series that I found myself utterly and truly involved.
"Loosing Impetus: I want to be fair and objective about this series so, I have to begin by saying that the first 4 volumes were excellent. Since then, however, the series has gotten progressively more boring. If Brian Jordans ambition was to see how long he could drag out a story he has succeeded. The earlier tension and plot have been lost and much like Terry Goodkinds' ""Wizards 1st Rule"", the ""Wheel of Time"" seems to have lost its way. Every book, and this one is no exception, introduces a stream of new characters whose purpose in the tale seems ornamental at best. Please finish this series in the next book."
"Stop This Thief: This series hardly promises to be new or unique. Unlike others, I don't care that Jordan rips off Tolkien (trollocs, anyone?). Instead, I'm furious that he has stolen characters straight out of Eddings's Belgariad: the sturdy blacksmith with down-to-earth values, the haughty, blue-clad, imperious sorceress, the vagabond old man storyteller, and even a connection with wolves. The opening of the first book, where Rand suspects some shadowy figure following him is also straight out of Pawn of Prophecy. Why hasn't Eddings sued this poser? Also, the boys vs. girls theme that Eddings began to take a little too far by the 8th book (in the Mallorean) is already overdone obnoxiously by the end of book 1. Surely we can find better authors that don't steal their ideas straight from better sources. Read Eddings and compare for yourself. Jordan is a thief."
"I am more to blame than Jordan: I was vacationing in Kenya when I finished ""Eldest"" and needed a new book desperately. The only book of interest I found a bookstore in Mombasa was Crossroads of Twilight. For some reason I do not remember, I read all previous 9 books in the Wheel of Time epic (and I use that in the negative sense). So I place the blame squarely on my shoulders for reading such an awful book.Jordan creates a fascinating world, but after Book III, he gets lost in his own story. Honestly, and without exaggeration, there is not ONE plot development in this book. Yes, that's correct: not one thing of importance happens in the 800+ pages. Unfortunately, that has become the norm for Robert Jordan. If you just have to finish this series (I am officially at the ""I could care less"" stage), do yourself a favor and skip this book and go on to Book XI."
672 Pages of Nothing: This book was utter crap. Nothing happens in the entire book. I'll not be reading another one of these books until the last one is finally published.
"Skim it, at best: I've had it with Jordan. This is the last book of the Wheel of Time I will ever buy. I regret buying this one. Professional reviewers call for patience, ask us to wait because the NEXT book will be interesting. Give me a break! Jordan is spooning out endlessly tiresome minutae and characters that have little to do with the promised Last Battle. Besides, if the conclusion of this series ever happens, who is going to possibly remember a character in book seven, relating to one in ten, and back to something we all read years and years ago? If Jordan was a new author, this book would never be published."
"while i do not beleive he is trying to milk the story: for all its worth, i DO think he has failed to excercise restrain over it. An author does write for the story, but he realy should look and see if all this detail and touching bases with the previous story threads (which we already know) are actualy making for a better story. I don't think so, NONE of the fans i've talked to don't seem to think so, and i wonder if he's gone back to read over his own work.The plot doesn't advance, the characters don't develop.. there's absolutely nothing here. Borrow this book from someone else unfortinate enough to have shelled out money for it, or check it out of the library. If you have a while, read the last couple of chapters. Hopefully either the story will pull mr jordan back towards a story, or someone will point out how glacial he's become. Either way,i am looking forward to the next book, albeit with some trepidation that it too will be this awful"
"Skip this book!!!: I have followed this series since the beginning, and I felt ripped off by the lack of action and movement that occured. I thought that the book had basically been written to make a few more bucks out of the people foolish enough to keep reading them. There are perephial characters added that may be pertainent to the ending, however, do nothing to advance the current story, and at the end of the book all of the characters are pretty much where they were at the beginning. I hardly think there is much that couldn't just have gone straight into the next book, and would suggest that unless you get this book free, or very inexpensively, to skip it, and hope the next one has more movement towards the conclusion of the story."
"Ho hum,: Another in a long line of so-so books. they all have moments, I'll give you that. Just enough to keep me coming back for more. I will finish this series. I will! I will! I will! Though sometimes it's like going to your grandmother's house, fun at times but you'd rather not if you dont have too. A new author, Brian S, Pratt of The Unsuspecting Mage gave me what Mr. Jordan has been lacking in the last few of his novels. Action. There's none of this page after page of descriptions, he let's the reader's imagination fill in most of it. Mr. Jordan has lost track of what a reader wants, escapism, excitement, and most of all action! Maybe he should take a lesson from this newcomer and revitalize what was once a great series."
nothing happened!: Just read the last chapter and you'll be ready for the next book. Definately don't get this as a hardcover. It was VERY boring.
"this is why characters get ignored in books: I think it may have hit us why only a few people get mentioned per book before, he has split up so many story lines that it's not even funny. it's time for him to bring the boys back together, and reduce the differnt story lines again. I almost think he was trying to see if it's even possible to split that many characters at once.I think the last 4 books could be re-released featuring only a single character, and still might even be able to stand on their own, slightly. This sure isn't the old Conan stuff he did early 80's. but it's still better than the middle books"
"How can you write 700 pages and not have anything happen?: Here's how this one works. At the end of Book 9, some big stuff happened with Rand (no details in case you haven't read 9). This book is all about what the other characters were doing while Rand was doing his thing in Book 9. Here's the problem: There are about 5 chapters dedicated to what each main character was doing and how they learned about Rand's big day, and 1 dedicated to new action. And none dedicated to folks like the Children of the Light or Morgase. In short NOTHING HAPPENS, not even much politics. It's like a 700 page epiologue for Book 9. We don't even get to find out more about what was going on in Book 10's 95 page preface . . .Very disappointed. Hope George R.R. Martin can avoid this with his series . . ."
"Flash!!! TOR editors piece together WOT 10 from scraps: Two years is a long time to wait to see how much embroidery and lace Matt has come to like on his clothes. ""Glacial"" as one review suggests isn't even the word for the pace of the last two books. When RJ (or whoever) actually does advance any story line he does it in less than a paragraph, or, as a teaser. I truly enjoy this series, and if it never concluded that would be fine with me, but lets have a story. Before you buy this one, re-read the other nine, then re-read them again. There will be less time to brood between book 10 and book 11. The rest of us will just have to keep reading the Song of Ice and Fire series to keep ourselves occupied."
"Unbelievable: I have never posted a review for any product that I have purchased before in my life, until now. It is roughly 4:00 am Pacific Standard Time and I have just finished reading ""Crossroads of Twilight"" by Robert Jordan. All I can say is that I wish I would have read the reviews about this book before I spent my hard earned money on it. Moreover what I would really like to state in the politest way possible is; Never never never will Robert Jordan get another red sent of my money...! What utter craap...!"
"Support your local library: Save your money and get this from a library. Mr Jordan has milked this tale long enough. It's a pity he does not respect the readers enough to end it. Prequel? Nah, I wanted an end to the story, not more beginings."
"Wretched: I feel unclean.I forced myself to finish this book just in case I might have found an enjoyable chapter somewhere inside it. Sadly, Robert Jordan fails to deliver even one.The writing of this series once appeared great, but in retrospect, Jordan is a hack. The man got lucky, and is now trying to milk his early success for every penny. I for one, will not contribute to his royalty checks ever again.This book truly is awful, please, don't encourage him."
"Review of reviews: I once loved Wheel of Time. But around book 6 or 7, it became clear that Jordan has stopped telling a story. I haven't bothered to read more than the (90 page!) prologue of this one and leaf through the rest... bookstores are good for browsing. From the many angry reviews here, I can see that book 10 does not restart the story any more than book 8 or 9 did. So - if you MUST read it, wait for a used paperback copy to show up. I'm going to skip the next ten WoT books."
"...: The biggest disappointment in WOT series. If you have not read it, then don't.If you still want to read it then go to a book store, read the last flap and that's just what the whole book is about.Nothing happens here, the characters just go on musing, thinking and Jorden goes on descibing the weather.It was the first book of the series in which I skipped pages after pages then got bored even doing that and just read the last chapter to know if anything happens. It doesn't.The book is like an illogical movie you are watching and wondering how did this happen, how did that happen? The earlier well built characters start behaving ""uncharacterstically"", including Rand..... I have learned one thing by this book. I will not buy the 11th book without reading the reviews."
"Sub par: 700 pages, thousands upon thousands of words, numerous characters, and various plots all get summed up nicely in this title.The book we have waited two years for was a dissappointment. To sum it up, nothing happens. The main story was not advanced in the slightest, it seemes that Jordan decided to use this book to let us know that he could milk this series for as much money as he wanted, and we would still buy into it no matter how mediocre it is getting.Sub plots were tied up, characters with little play in previous books get much more time on stage, yet... the book advances the storyline perhaps a week.We would have been better served by Jordan waiting another two years to put out a book that was worth the time it takes to read it."
"Snore...: This is a book that could have been sumated in the prologue/introduction. It really does move slow, and unfortunately repeats itself in parts. Jordan has woven so many characters into his pattern, that he's struggling to mention them all, and sometimes glossing over the main characters. This book seems to be a slump where he attempted to bring some of those loose ends together, and fails. I'd cross my arms, and sniff...but it's not worth the effort. At least we have the new George R.R. Martin book to look forward to soon..."
"Jordan should have stopped with #7: Jordan has again diverged from the main characters. Mat and Perrin have some time but Rand is nearly non-existant. Prolonging the story, Jordan needs to get back to the basics, wrap up these characters stories and please do so better than the Taint wrap-up (too rushed) in the last book.Pick-up George RR Martin instead or reread the first 7-8 books of Jordan."
"But nothing happens!: I do not doubt that Robert Jordan is an excellent story-teller, but the effort is wasted here. The entire book of 675 pages spans but a month in ""real-time"" and advances the entire series not a bit. Save your money and skip this book, you'll miss nothing in the entire series. In fact, the galatial pace of the last three books makes me doubtful that this series will every come to an end. Not only is the pace slow, it is becoming ever slower.Instead, this book's many pages are devoted to various political intrigues, and endless profusion of proper names, and rich descriptions of everybody's attire. Personally, I'd much rather know what is going on in Rand's mind than a detailed description of every outfit he dons.Bottom line - I'm sorry I wasted the time reading it."
"Extremely Disappointing: I thought that maybe Jordan had revived himself after he actually had some interesting plot lines in Book Nine. However, I was just wishfully thinking since I have invested so much time and money in this series. There was virtually no advancement in the plot and he even had the nerve to throw in some stuff that sets the movement back. If you haven't bought this book, don't."
"Massive Dissapointment: This was in my opinion the worst book of the series. The book felt long while reading it and overall nothing really occurred to give any direction to the plot, it became a feeling of is it over yet while I was reading it. Basically just filler between books, and it was the once book in the series I didn't feel was worth reading."
"Where's the Dragon?: I must like to suffer, because I hurried down and bought this book that can't keep me reading for more than fifteen minutes. So much time is spent on those god awful Aes Sedai, that their names are just one big jumble. If the writer would just stick to the STORY and the characters from the first book, the reading would be much more enjoyable, and would make more sense. I am on page 447, and I keep telling myself it will get better, but Jordan must be trying to hypnotize me with his words that are in italics that cannot be verbalized. I think I'll stick with R. A. Salvator'e from now on.Ken"
"I waited for this???: There is an old saying, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. Well, what do you say when you have been fooled at least 5 times by the same author?I kept turning the pages thinking, something must happen sometime! And the characters! Suspension of disbelief? No sane person in any world would make the decisions the characters here do. It is just becoming unbelievable (as if magic were believable in the first place) and I find myself just wishing someone would simply nuke the white tower and get it over with. I mean, who cares anymore?Is Mr. Jordan simply milking us for more money? Seems like this was the topic of conversation with the last novel.Well, I've been fooled again..."
"Don't waste your time with this one: This book has got to be the worst of the series to date. Not only does the plot go nowhere, the writing is horrible as well. It feels like RJ has just copy and pasted sentences from the other nine books. His descriptions are the same old tired phrases that I've grown to dislike even hate. I often laugh while reading this book... not because it is funny but because i wasted my money on it. Go to the internet and read the Chapter summaries instead of buying it."
"Tedious: No matter how quickly or how slowly Jordan wraps up this series, there is no excuse for this exercise in inaction. There are, maybe, 6 pages of enjoyable reading in this tome, of which, possibly 2 advance the plot. This is far worse than 6, 7, or 8 in the series - something I thought, and hoped, I would never write.If you've read the prior nine, then you may want to wait for this to be remaindered, or read it softbound. You could probably learn everything you need to know from the book in 5 minutes on line (which isn't much).Otherwise, frankly, it isn't worth your time unless you graduated at the top of an Evelyn Wood Speed-Reading Class. One can only hope that if Jordan does decided to wrap this up soon, that he will deliver at least two decent novels to end the series, and make amends with the public that has supported him over the years."
"The Worst Book Ever Writt.en: Garbage! This book should be used for kindling only. Your entertainment dollars would be put to better use purchasing a book describing mildew growing on bathroom tiles. I believe the pretentious Mr. Jordan has begun to think of himself in terms of Mellville, Dumas, and Tolstoy which is reflected in his writing. However, he lacks the talent for tying together plot lines, he introduces an endless cast of irrelevant characters and has a penchant for endless, repetitious descriptions of meaningless activities.I have the feeling that either Mr. Jordan is suffering from severe ""writer's block"" and delivered this book to his editor only to meet his publishing deadline or is producing these books only to become wealthy at the expense of his readers. Either way, if brevity is indeed the soul of wit, Mr. Jordan is a moron."
Wake-up and Smell the Coffee: Anybody who buys this book must be masochistic. The last book was a joke on the faithful readers who invested much time and money on this series(i.e. 200 pages on Egwene getting the Nobles permission to travel w/ her army--what a bore!). That was enough to convince me that Jordan has lost touch with reality.
Very let down: I agree that this series has become very drawn out with the last couple of books and this book has just made it alot worse.It's amazing the amount of irrelevant details that this book contains. the only detail that I can think of that Robert Jordan missed out is how long Matts hair nose has grown from page to page.
"4 chapters stretched out to 600+ pages: WoT, at this point reminds me of a puzzle from the Infocom text adventure Beyond Zork. At one point, the player character finds him/herself on a bridge. With every step across the bridge, the character moves at a decreasing rate, finding himself 1/2, 3/4ths, 7/8ths, 15/16ths, 35/36ths... of the way across the bridge but can never cross because he moves forward less and less with each move. The only escape is to leap from the bridge. With WoT, each book advances the plot less and less (this book actually moves backwards, starting with a different perspective on events before the conclusion of the last book - yikes). At this point, Book 12 will cover 1 day from the perspective of 100 characters and will consist entirely of braid pulling, sniffing, arm folding, descriptions of baths, etc... The only escape is to make a complete break from the series altogether (I know I'll never bother with it again) - the equivalent of Beyond Zork's bridge jump."
"Painful: This book was truly a waste of time.. Very little happens to progress the story, go ahead and skip this one"
"Outsmart the GREEDY BAS_ _ _ _: It's plain and simple. Jordan is just too lazy to take the time to write a good ending to the series. He's also a huge sell-out and a GREEDY B (I mean, come on, who else charges for a prologue?). We are, however, somewhat attached to his characters.Easy solution: Borrow the book from you public library. You get to read the story; he doesn't get any money. So what if you have to wait a week or two for your library to get a copy. It's not like you haven't waited years for the series to do something .At one point, Jordan was thought of as Tolken's equal. Let's see how well his money consoles him when he realizes he gave up a place in Literary history for a few bucks that he'll waste before he comes back trying to sell us some more trash."
"Ready to give up on Mr. Jordan: I am ready to give up on Mr. Jordan and this series. The first 6 or so books in this series only took me about 3 nights each to read, 7-9 took me awhile longer. The 10th took me over a month to finally get through it. No action, slow slow slow. He actually seems to be stretching this line out for every penny. When he takes a half a page just to describe what someone is wearing, its time to move on to a new author. He is doing what drove me from reading Stephen King. Long pointless dialog. The editors need to get on Mr. Jordan to end this. When the next novel comes out I will be reading the reviews of it before I buy it. If everyone is complaining, I will be passing it up. Everyone should, just to give Mr. Jordan the message that enough is enough."
"I liked it: Why do you all waste your time if you do not like Jordan and why wasting my time to read your stupid reviews? Jordan's creating a world on its own and things in it don't allways develop like in action movies. More action, is that what's needed, ahh? Then watch TV, don't read books!!! There is an almost medieval intrigue in this last book and I enjoyed it fully but not everybody can"
Shame on you Jordan for sqandering our trust on this...: ... horrible WASTE of time!What a huge collection of hot-aired babble! It is 800 pages of virtually nothing. The plot of the story went almost no where and could be summerized if even needed in a couple of chapters. Bla-Bla-bla Drama! Do not waste your money! Do not waste your time!
"Awful beyond words: Jordan's continued slide into the abyss of worthlessness continues unabated. While most of his books contain hundreds of pages of filler, this one has nothing else. No plot advancement occurs at all. A complete waste of time and money."
"So disappointed: Jordan could have wrapped this entire book up in 10 chapters or 140 pages and given everyone almost as much enjoyment to the reader, but I suppose he wanted 25$ from us instead. If you feel like spoilers, you could summerize EVERYTHING important in this book in 3 paragraphs.Basically 1/2 to 2/3 of the entire book encompasses what everyone else was doing while Rand was at Shadar Logarth and the other part was either non essential or boring. While detail in the Jordan WOT universe is a great thing, writing a book like this is not a good way for repeat customers.Will I purchase the next book, yes. Why? Because I hope it will be as good as all the books before this one.This book I own just to keep the collection whole"
"I AM DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: As the title says I AM DONE! Reading Jordan's books that is. It took me three weeks to finally finish this incredibly boring edition in the WoT series. There were over 800 pages of absolutely nothing. Nothing but paragraph long sentences that you had to read three times to figure out that they didn't say anything. Robert Jordan, don't give up your day job. (unless it's writing)"
"Not again!: I've actually come full circle with this book:I borrowed book 1 from a friend, and loved it, so I went out and bought a copy, along with books 2-7.Books 8 &amp; 9 I bought in a secondhand bookstore, as I was starting to become jaded with the series.With Crossroads, I've reverted to simply borrowing it from a friend again, only this time, I have no intention of paying for my own copy, because I don't think I'll ever be re-reading it."
"The local library...: I urge you not to buy this book. It seems RJ has decided to prolong WOT indefinantly. I found myself skimming most of this episode, searching for a glimpse of interest or a glimmer of plot advancement. It seems RJ has run out of ideas and decided to bore us senseless. The book focuses on Elayne and her strive to attain the crown - probably the most uninteresting part of the whole series. So, check it out at the local library but don't waste your money on it."
"I give up: I've been following this series for years and was vastly disappointed with the last few. *This* one however, says nearly nothing for 680 pages. The worthwhile parts could be compressed into 80 pages. Pages and pages of comments on clothes, the scenery, looks, thoughts and *nothing* happening.Two possible reasons, possibly a combination of both:1 ) RJ has painted himself into a corner and doesn't know how to get out yet.2 ) The resolution is closer than we think and RJ does not want his revenue stream to end and is deliberately stretching it out.Myself, I refuse to buy any more of this series until it is complete. At this rate, I'll be buying books in 2050."
"Worst in the series, but you should still read it: The other reviews on the site really speak for themselves; however, I did want to put my 2 cents in. I would not say that I hated this book, but there is zero plot development. The pace is slow, and nothing is resolved... all of the characters are literally in the exact same situation at the end as they where when the book started.That being said, DO NOT loose hope on the WOT. The upcoming books are MUCH better, especially 12 and 13. I look at book 10 as a ""bump in the road"" to an otherwise great, epic series. Don't stop reading, there is a light at the end of the tunnel!"
"this was junk: RJ was never much of a writer to start with, but this is an all-time low, even for him. What is the point of this book? It is all filler--for his bank account. His analogies are either stupid of funny. Take for example this one: ""it (the news) hit her ear like an awl."" How stupid. Did her ear begin to bleed? Geez. I'm too bored witht this ""book"" to even go through any of my other complaints. Oh well. Plenty of other reviewers will no doubt take up the slack. I would like to agree with the above reviewer who pointed out that just because so many of us hate this book doesn't mean we should shut up or write or own books. It just means we actually have standards above the 7th grade. We just like to have believable, interesting characters instead of cloned boring ones."
"There's a problem with this novel people are not addressing.: I see a lot of the people who liked this book saying ""Guys stop complaining, Robert Jordan's just setting things up!""Yes, Robert Jordan partially has been setting things up for about 4 books. This is true. But these last four books are also suffering from an egregious amount of PADDING, padding that has nothing to do with setting up a plot.For example, when the Aes Sedai meet, it takes them 4... pages just to sit down. Four long boring pages?! Is this necessary?This book is just chock full of useless details that have been repeated ad nauseum since Crown of Swords. If you want to hear about Aes Sedai breast size to the most pedantic minutae, or if Nynaeve yanking her braid ten times in five pages fascinates you, or you want to read about Egwene crossing her arms beneath her breasts, or any number of oft-repeated and useless details, then by all means, read this book."
"Holy sucky soap operas Batman!: I just finished Jordan's latest installment and I must say, it's the most disappointing book I have ever read. I'd suggest a Cliff Notes version but if you distilled the endless drivel down to substantial events, I'm not sure if you could even fill ten pages. Heck, if you took all the ""<fill in the name> straightened here skirts"" phrases out, you'd drop a hundred pages right there.Yes, Jordan is a very talented writer and I enjoyed earlier works in this increasingly dissapointing series. And, yes, I'm sure it will have a fantastic ending. But, I must ask... What in the world did he readers do to deserve this abomination?Jordan, if you're listening to your readers... End it already!"
"One of the best books for all the dog people: This story reminds us that dogs are the best companions for human-beings. The firm and genuine friendship between Nero and Patrache is clearly described against the background of the dark, cold, gloomy weather of the northern country, and against the coldness of their neighbors who misunderstand much about them. If you like this kind of tragic story and want to read another one, please check outeHACHI|KO MONOGATARI'. This story (=MONOGATARI) is also focused on the close relationship between a human (a Japanese) and a dog. This is a touching tale, too. Unfortunately, however, I'm not sure whether it is translated in English or not. Anyway, I do recommend eA dog of Flanders', the most famous masterpiece of Ouida."
Take a Trip!: A real nice job of puting together the music on this CD.one of the best covers of Route 66 by any band is on this CD
"Disliked it I'm afraid: I am SHOCKED at how many loved this book! I hate to put negative comments on Amazon...but I don't think I could have slept tonight if I didn't comment on this one. I thoroughly disliked this book I'm afraid. I really struggled trying to even finish it. It had HORRIBLE language btw. Luckily my sister had edited for me before she loaned it to me. I really would not recommend this to anyone. Sorry:(...like I said I hate to be negative, but this book just was NOT for me."
no multi lane sata cables included: Would love to try this card out since I just ordered it however it doesn't come with the necessary mini sas -> x4 sata multilane 3ware breakout cable. Something to be aware of if you order this. Amazon sells the cable for about 18$.It would be nice if there was some indication that this was an OEM barebone card in the description.I'll update the review once the card is up and running.
"Highly disappointed: Dickies Men's 13 Inch Inseam Work Short With Multi Use Pocket, Khaki, 36 is my worst buying experience through Amazon. The price is normal but the cloth is so though (like a plastic table cloth) that you feel as if you are touching a sand paper. And the style of it? My wife and my sohn started laughing as I first tried it on. How they produce and sell something like this? I returned the item right away."
"Underneath Everything Else Lies An Optimism About The Future Of The Human Species: This work from the greatest writer of science fiction's golden age contains legendary stories end to end. Set on the earth of the past, present and future, as well on a host of foreign worlds in the most distant reaches of space, Bradbury offers up a full range of tales from scary musings about mortality and human destiny, to fantastic glimpses into the reality that might lie ahead. Bradbury's imagination caresses the written word and gives his creations a power that won't be found anyplace else. The Illustrated Man is a life-affirming vote of confidence that (for good or for ill) other ages of man are yet to come."
"Illustrated Man review: The Illustrated Man was not a interesting book to read. It never appealed to me. Maybe I am biased because I never liked science-fiction, but not only that, this book was the pinnacle of confusion. I had to read a story from the book twice just to get the point of a story.Even though i disliked this book, I did like quotes from the book. My favorite quote of this book is, ""More than food or a woman or amything, I just want Earth."" This quote shows that people need Earth. Living on Earth is blessing and people don't know that.Despite me not liking the book, this book should be read. You learn many things from the book. It had many points and can be used to teach many things in life. Although this book had good points, it did not have thing that captivates you to read a book. It took be a month to read this because the book was not interesting."
"ZzZzZ...: I don't mean to offend Ray Bradbury, but I didn't understand half of this book. I mean, some of the stories are quite unique, but once I read on and on about the other stories, I got so confused and bored. I didn't like this book much."
"Best required reading I ever done: This book is fabulous! Never since my early childhood did a book influence my life. I enjoyed the wide variety of main characters, each with their own faults and virtues. It was very easy to link these characters to my own life and catch a glimpse of what obstacles may be in my future. Also, I like the fact that it was easy and imaginative. Most of the stories contain a twist that kept me in suspense until the very end. Those complaining about lenght have nothing to fear because the words are easy so reading long paragraphs can even take under a minute to complete.I recommend this novel for required reading because this novel contains many purposeful themes. Unfortunately, I cannot put my favorite meaningful quote here because it spoils a story but it changed my life! I saw how miserable a man became and I realized that the way he led his life is almost like mine; I did not want to share his depressing fate."
"Illustrated Man: ""Listen, Keep your ears clean, smell the smells of a rocket. Feel. Remember. So when you return you will talk of it all the rest of your lives."" The Illustrated Man should be required reading. Author Bradbury, Ray well organized eighteen tales, fill with life questions and answers. Although most of the stories were not carrying a person along, however it gave an astonished notion to people. The way he forecasted the future was closely related to the present world. It was also startled that he had thought of this concept and idea before 55 years ago. After finishing the novel, it made me surprise of the prodigy idea and richness words of Bradbury.I have an opinion that The Illustrated Man should be all state required books for all teens. I think it brings new views of teens about the coming generation."
For love of evil: I absolutly loved this book.; Piers ASnthony incorperated all of his other novels so they interwind together [pure genius!] The book itself is A class and if you read the other stories you can gasp at the recognition. The events are the same only from different perspectives. I thought this to be quite appealing considering that Piers Anthony is the best writer that ever breathed. I demand that you read this book!
"Loving Evil: This is one of the best books in the universe. It explains for how the immortal Satan was in life, death, and beyond. It explains how he shakes the earth with evil, and even makes a deal with the Angel Gabriel. This explains why there is more evil in the world than good, and the purpose of life. It has much logic and isn't for a non-commited person. It's long enough to be satisfying, and short enough to be interesting. Piers Anthony did it again!"
"Cute, but not for the absentminded: Perfect size for me, cheery to look at, pours very well, but developed rust spots on the interior during the first week: not good. Worse, this kettle has no whistle, and when I absentmindedly let it boil dry one day, part of the handle melted. They say it is heat-resistant plastic, but it decidedly isn't. If you can't keep an eagle eye on it, get something else."
MAN LIKE ME....THE BEST!!!: I AM A LOYAL COUNTRY MUSIC FAN...AND I LIKE IT ALL. BUT HERE LATELY I'VE BOUGHT PROBABLY 6 OR 7 CDS...AND MAN LIKE ME HAS SUPPASSED EVERY ONE OF THEM!!! BOBBY IS PURE COUNTRY AND THE LYRICS ARE BREATHTAKING!!!! THIS IS ONE CD I ACTUALLY LOVE...AND CHERISH EACH SONG!!!
"A New Voice: This album is a breath of fresh air, far different from the over-produced pop-country songs I've been hearing. Pinson's voice has a raw-edged quality that is perfect for the delivery of lyrics that (gasp) actually have some meaning. The album is worth buying for the hit-single ""Don't Ask Me How I Know"" all on it's own, but that is just the beginning. This is an album full of songs about real people in real situations that we can all relate to, and pulls you into singing along with him. One of the best country albums this year!"
"An excellent first from this newcomer!: These days I find that I cannot stand the newer artists that are hitting Nashville, but Bobby Pinson is an exception. His songs have a realism, you know that they happened to him, and you know he believes them. Pinson has made one of the best first recordings I have ever heard, and I hope he continues to sing songs with the same heart as he did in this one. An excellent addition to your CD collection."
"Misleading Product Information: Please be aware that this is not as currently** described in the Product Description:""Pack of ten best-selling Bookworms ideal for building up class libraries.

When a newspaper has a grammatically awkward headline, it can be funny. On the other hand, a grammatically messed-up product description results in a lot of hassle in having to return something that ended up being way over-priced for a single, skinny-little reader title.**As on the date of this review."
"Very disappointing: I was looking forward to a verbal journey. A talk with musicians and poets, historians and purveyors of folklore. And I got a little of that. Very little.This is a very short volume, and more than I'd like is made up of excerpts of past books. This should be a little spice for the stew, not a major ingredient.In the whole, it reads as a dry (and there is the main problem, it is dry) history lesson.Again it is short. It would have worked as well as a long magazine article."
"in a word...: Fantastic.Beautiful, superbly acted, wonderfully cast and directed.I just. cannot. understand. the negative. reviews. *shaking head*"
"Sub-par: It's only a testament to how good a director Ron Howard is that I write to express my disappointment in this really slow-moving film.It just never really seems to come together on any level. Howard's films are traditionally extremely character driven and I was shocked when that seemed to be the movie's main failing. What drove Cate Blanchett and Tommy Lee Jones's characters were just never really explored. It wasn't for lack of time either, clocking in at over two hours, the film was far too long.I don't want to give the wrong impression either; it certainly wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen. It's more that when Howard's on we get movies like Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind. I was really disappointed that, by the bar he set for himself, this film is WAY below his ability. At over twenty dollars I couldn't possibly recommend buying a copy"
"Good to see Once...I think: If you are considering seeing this movie, I would recommend it. I enjoyed it and I am not really a fan of Westerns. I don't know if I would add this movies to my DVD collection,but it is definately worth seeing at least once."
Great movie: I have watched this movie numerous times and now I have it in my collection and I can watch it any time I want to. Thanks for a great movie.
"Hurricane Bay by Heather Graham: I can't get enough of Heather Graham books. This one was alittle more romance less ghosts. Still it was enjoyable read. She has a way with her charcters that make you want to like them . The Kelsey/Dane romance was written well, it makes you feel what they feel. I can recommend her books to all types of readers."
"Crackling noise: I received this product in good shape. However, it makes loud noises when it is heating, almost like fire cracker. Had to return and get a replacement.Amazon provided excellent service. Quickly shipped a second one and took the first one back without charging me shipping."
Provence: Very disappointing.... The photographs are not great and did not give me a feel for the region. At least not in the way it has been described to me. This book does not live up to its name. It does not make me want to visit Provence.
"Tie before you fly.: This handy book provides a detailed instructions for tying a wide variety of flies that will be useful when flyfishing in Alaska. The book is organized into chapters devoted to a particular type of fishing (i.e., still water, streamers, saltwater, etc.). A set of handy tables matching up fly to species and time of the year is provided. Also included is information on how to fish the various flies.Another two related books of interest are ""Flyfishing Alaska"" by Route and ""Fly Patterns of Alaska"" by the Alaska Flyfishers."
"Hard to get cans started: Poorly engineered can opener.It is VERY difficult to get a can started. If you keep trying, after a dozen or two dozen tries you'll get the can to open.. But you would have saved much time and frustration using your old hand held opener.Very disappointing design."
WORST CAN OPENER EVER!!!: This can opener took forever to install and now that it is installed doesn't work well AT ALL. if it actually decides it's going to hold a can it drops it as soon as its done opening it. I will be staying away from the Black and Decker brand from here on out!
"Impossible to mount: Impossible to mount under a normal cabinet. May be possible in Chinawith their cabinets, but not in the USA."
"Black & Decker under counter can opener: This thing is gutless. It will barely, and frequently doesn't finish opening the can before it just quits and grinds away. It is very difficult to get the can to attach to the blade, and even when you it will not work. I am very disappointed in the product. I have used B & D can openers for years, but never had one that was so hard to work."
"You Get What You Pay For: They changed the hole pattern(more holes). They went to a knife edge (this makes a jagged edge) so it makes it harder to pierce some cans.You will find a lot of slop in the handle. You get spacers to lower the opener. I used the two wide spacers, you get a total of four. If you need more you will need to make your own (washers, wood or over size nuts).I think you would have to be smart as a fence post to give it 5 starsOf course there isn't a lot of options out there. People would ratherbuy 3 of junk then 1 good one. The market decides.It cost about $5 to make this item, and for less then $2 more they could double the quality. This item sales for $16-$18 in the dept. stores."
"best ever: This book is an amazing book! It goes through the life of high end riders doing the big eq. It shows different lives each riders have and what they have to give up to do their dream. THe book is very well developed and it is an amazing book, the best ive read. I would say its more of 14+ readers from somethings. They had a twist on the ending and what happened and its not a normal predictable story."
Best book ever: This book is amazing. Our newborn baby (3 weeks old) was crying and crying at night. We couldn't get her to stop. I plopped on the bed and started reading this book and boy oh boy did the techniques made her stop crying; it was amazing.It is also very helpful because they teach you how to swaddle and then how to wean the baby off the swaddle when they are ready. The best book ever!
"Great Info, Too Wordy: Great info with supporting facts and examples, but this could definitely be recapped to half the length it is and still get the point across just fine.As far as how effective his method is, my OBGYN and birth coach swear by it, and I use swaddled and shhh my baby all the time with great results. He isn't a fan of pacifiers so I'm just waiting patiently as he explores sucking his hand now (7weeks). And he loves his FIsher Price swing to entertain him and put his to sleep. I would definitely recommend this book, especially if you have a fussy baby!"
A well-written practical book: The book gives a complete review of diseases and vaccines so the reader can make an educated and informed decision of each vaccine for their child. . You will appreciate it on many levels. This book is a must for any new parents. The information is a life safer for your kidsWhen you have babies you can't go without these titles:The Poisoned Needle: Suppressed Facts about VaccinationThe Vaccination Myth: Courageous MD exposes the Vaccination Fraud!Vaccination Horror: An anthology of important works on vaccination pseudoscienceVaccination: Spreading Leprosy and DeathVaccination: State sponsored Murder
"Book vs. DVD: I've seen this method in action and it seems to work, so no issues there. The book is very repetitive. But it didn't take long as it was an easy read. He could probably cut out half the pages if he didn't review what he already said over and over again. The DVD is much more to the point and the visual is good, which is why I rented it from the library for my hubby to watch. It was much easier to watch the 40 minute DVD than to get my hubby to read through the book. Same message. The book only gives a little more background information on debunking the ""causes"" of colic - going through each one and discussing, where in the DVD he gets straight to his methods. While I like the book, I think it would have been better to take out of the library and return. Once you know the info, there's no reason to refer back to it."
"poorly written but right on the money: it's a god send. Try every counter-intuitive advice inside and you will that it works.But unlike this review, it draaaaaaags so much longer than it should."
"Just OK: This book contains a lot of filler...things like background stories that really don't have anything to do with solutions for a crying baby. Luckily, the chapters are labeled well so those parts can be skipped. Basically, you're reading one or two pages of real substance per chapter. This book has been made into DVD and is available on Netflix so I'd go that route before buying this book."
"Not for older babies: I was disappointed to find that the entire book is for newborn babies only. Once your baby is too old to swaddle this book isn't for you. I purchased several others at the same time and found that The No Cry Sleep Solution has great ideas for all babies and even toddlers. The ideas in the happiest baby book cannot be applied to a baby that is over about 3 months old. If you look at the main points you'll see they are: swaddling, placing on his side or stomach, saying Shhhh, Swinging, and Sucking. I also suspect that if you always do this with your newborn you may create sleep problems for when you can't do them any more. Beware! If your baby is over 3 months this isn't the book you are looking for."
"Fabulous resource for parents of newborns: Why hasn't anyone else thought to explain the basics of baby soothing to new parents? This book simply outlines the time-honored techniques of swaddling, swaying and shhing a baby and provides brilliant help for parents dealing with babies who have colic. The reassuring tone helps you feel like you are not alone. Great for the first few months, and if your baby is past the newborn stage I'd recommend a book that Dr. Karp wrote the introduction to called Gentle Baby Care (by Pantley, the baby sleep expert.)"
"There are much better books on the subject: Dr. Karp's book wasn't very helpful for us, it is also unnecessary lengthy, full of repetitions, and stories that are of little help. I wish I didn't buy his book, but bought Marc Weissbluth's ""Your fussy baby"" instead. I am reading Weissbluth's book now and find it so much more informative and interesting, fullof interesting up to date research information and recommendations on how to deal with crying and sleeping problems in babies."
Too much fluff: There is some solid advice in this book however it could have been written in a pamphlet. The author uses way too many words and too many examples to prove his point. He makes you read through way too much history to get to the good useful points.
"Overall A Good Book: Good book overall--has a lot of useless info in it and could be cut down to a smaller size with just the ""pointers"" for parents. Basically, Swaddle, swish, sway and go from there. Didn't work overall for us, but I used some of the info to soothe my son. Liked the Baby Whisperer better."
Great Book: All new mothers should read this book. Lots of very useful information for them. No more fussy babies!!
"Good for night sleeping: I heard about the 5 S's through the hospital classes and even received a swaddling blanket from the hospital when we left after giving birth, BUT nothing worked quite right until I read this book. If you are going to try and implement the 5 S's or Cuddle Cure, buy or borrow this book!"
"Creating order out of chaos: As a first time mother with a colicky newborn I felt my life had descended into chaos. Dr. Karp's book helped instill a sense of order and calm for both my son and me. The Happiest Baby on the Block philosophy and strategies make intuitive sense and, most importantly, worked to calm my baby. I now feel more in control and knowledgeable about ways to soothe my son. I'm also getting more sleep :) Instead of buying clothes or toys as gifts for new parents, I'm giving them this book."
"This works - do the five S's.: A family member gave us this book when we had our baby and it was a huge help. Buy a Swaddle Me or learn to swaddle wrap your baby tightly in a blanket, get a free white noise generator app for your phone (you will loose your voice saying 'shhhhh' otherwise) and if you can, buy a rocking chair and/or a baby swing - this will enable you to get some rest. The five 'S' 's actually work. Our baby is now 3 1/2 months old and this still works.This book is a very quick read (Dr. Karp repeats himself a bit) and the whole technique could have been put in a pamphlet but I don't begrudge Dr. Karp for making some money off of his technique since it enabled my partner and I to get some desperately needed sleep."
"what a lifesaver!: I have had 3 babies, and I thought I knew all the tricks to get them to sleep. But, my 3rd baby really didn't respond to them. So, I heard about this book, and bought it the next day! What great advice Dr. Karp gives.I have to say that I don't agree with some of the evolutional/caveman theories (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), but other than that...WOW! My baby responded immediately to the swaddling. He still wakes up once a night, but goes right back to sleep and spits up much less. He is much more easily soothed and falls asleep so quickly. THANK YOU, Dr. Karp, for your insight into babies!!Some reviewers have said that you don't need to buy the book, but I would recommend purchasing it. You will learn so much, whether it's your first or fifth baby!!"
"Best Baby On The Block: I bought this book for my daughter while she was expecting her first baby. I read the book before I gave it to her, and I found it to be the only parenting book that I have read which also closely mimicked my own parenting philosophy. The book is interesting to read and makes a lot of sense. In the meantime, my daughter and grandson are a happy, calm, team. She is employing the knowledge she's gained from this book and it has helped her and Baby tremendously. I also bought this as a gift for one of my daughter's friends who, after her baby arrived, was getting so many conflicting Do's and Don'ts from ""helpful"" family and friends that she didn't know what to do. She enjoyed reading the book, and the wisdom it imparted felt right to her, also."
Extremely good book: A very good book that looks at the ordinary lives of farmers' farm laborers and rural craftsmen in Victorian England. Very well researched.And written in a a very readable way
"Real suspense, at last: At this moment is really hard to find some movie with real suspense, in BOUND you'll find a lot of it."
"Overrated borefest now: ""Bound"" might've been hot stuff back in 1996, and I think this movie is still riding on that, but now it's just dated, mundane ""been there, done that."" I caught this on cable a few days ago, and it's a snoozefest. Maybe all the movies since this was released had rendered the femme fatale genre not a big deal anymore, and thus this movie is not a big deal anymore.It's just another DVD you'd be wasting your money on."
"Too good for the price: Had pretty much decided to go with Nuvi 350, but when I went in to store I found this cute little GPS for half the price. I bought it thinking would return it even if I find flaw, but I must say mio has surpassed all my expectations. The user interface is intuitive, but dont try to learn how to use the product from the manual. The manual sucks. The POI database is decent, infact its on par with all the other GPS's if you exclude the 3+ mill POI boasted by other manufactures that applicable to canada and europe :). Took this for my boston city and I am home back safely. Highly recommended"
"Product died after one year: This product was mediocre. Unfortunately it died just over one year of use. When it was working, occasionally it would do annoying things, for example, if you are driving on a freeway, it would say ""stay to the left"" as a means for you not to exit the freeway. If you are an obedient driver, you would move to the far left lane of the freeway, then as soon as an exit turnoff has passed, it would say ""now exit right"" and if there were lots of cars in the way, it would be difficult to make it all the way to the exit lane.The only thing I really liked about it was the British accent and that I can use the power source to charge my cellphone (Blackberry). Other then that, I'm sure there are much better GPS systems out there."
"I love the security the C220 provides: I've had my Mio C220 for about a week now and have found it to be very reliable. I've been using it to get around town to places I go to all the time. Some times it routes me differently than I would normally have gone but then I change the way it routes (from quickest to shortest...) and it will generally come up with my regular route.It really came in handy last night to get to a party down in the city where I wasn't use to driving. It's not normally the safest part of town at night but I felt very secure knowing how to get there. And when everyone wanted to continue the party at a local bar it was great to be able to hit that home button afterwards and find my way home without a worry of getting lost.If you are wanting to buy a reliable GPS and aren't just looking for a toy with Mp3 and Picture viewer or all the other wastes of memories, I highly recommend the Mio C220."
Don't buy this GPS: Do not waste your money on this GPS. It has a lot of features but you can't get the basic naviagtor to work. The screen is also to small. It seems to lose its signal every time I move it from the cradel.The power supply for the battery must last only 30 minutes with out the power cord.
"Old map data: The unit is nice and a great value however the map data is so old you will often not find your destination, which is really frustrating. Also don't bother with this unit if you are going to Canada ever. You may be better served by spending a little more and getting current maps. After all that is the reason for a nav system right?"
"Support/Warranty Horrible: Mio C220 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorGot the system for holiday present, thought initially it was affordable and had most of the features I wanted. HOWEVER, the touch screen was not responding and I pushed the section of the screen a little harder and the whole face of the screen cracked. I am on with tech support who may charge me to replace or fix the unit. Completely NOT what the warranty read. Great, cheap unit but they don't back it up if normal customer use presents a problem. Another $130 dollars out the window!"
"Nice hardware, but Mio won't sell you maps of other countries: I have grown to like this little unit quite a bit, but I have discovered that I made a bad assumption when I bought it. When I saw that the maps were on SD cards, I figured I would just be able to buy maps for other regions when I needed them. Not so, it turns out. I actually called Mio tech support to see where I could buy a map of Canada for my next trip to Toronto, and I was told that ""foreign"" maps won't work in the US units. The telephone rep had been pretty polite up to that point, but when I said I certainly wouldn't buy a a Mio in the future, because they aren't much use to folks who need to travel to Canada, she got kind of snippy. She said ""Well, that's your choice,"" and then added ""You can buy a separate Mio Canadian unit.""Yeah... or I could just buy a GPS that lets me install new maps.Steer clear of this one folks. It's not worth the ""savings."""
"BUYER BEWARE: Bad product, incompetent manufacturer: I bought the chains from Amazon and decided to try them on before I leave on my ski trip. Thanks God I did, because the chains didn't fit. I'm glad I didn't discover this on the road when I actually needed them.Before I ordered, I checked what the correct size for my tires (205/50-17) is. I checked both the manufacturer's web site and the guide on Amazon's web site and ordered the recommended SZ127 model. Amazon sent me the correct chains, my tire's size was listed on chain's bag, everything was perfect but the chains were too small and they didn't fit. They were not even close to the correct size - maybe close to half the size of my tires.If the company cannot get the most basic thing for tire chains right I highly doubt they are competent of creating a quality product. I would have given zero stars but Amazon doesn't let me."
Better than most: These cable chains offer maximum clearance between the cables and the car body. They are easier to install than others I've used because you don't have to drive over them. I would have given them 5 stars but there is still the same old hassle of getting enough slack in the chains to fasten that last connector.
"Awful - No Traction: Simply Awful !!! Didnt seem to provide any more traction than a regular tire, ruined my planned trip today by relying on them to provide traction up a reasonably steep grade.Yes they are easy to put on, and seemed to stay on pretty good while I was stuck spinning my wheels but going nowhere !"
"good idea poorly executed: No way to install these, defective attachment devices. Seems like a good idea for installing chains, but manufacturing error makes impossible to install. Could not install with car on the ground, on a lift or with the tire off the car. For what these cost, you think they would inspect at the factory before sending to distributors. I have been using tire chains of various types for over forty years and have never had this much trouble. Amazon accepted in return and refunded without problem."
WRONG SIZE!!!: The fitment guide is completely wrong compared to what the packaging for the chains said. I ordered SZ131 for my BMW 330ci tires 245/40/17 per the chart but they are too small... Very frustrated and annoyed that this company does not have their labels and charts correct.
"Do NOT buy this for 2010 Mazda6: The chain is very easy to install with bare hands, and the tensioner will keep it tight, don't need to retighten.Unfortunately it makes contact with the suspension on my 2010 Mazda6 with 205/65R16 tires. I have contacted SCC, and they recommended the SC1034 Radial Chain for my car. I replaced it, and it really fits, but it's more complicated to put on, and just to tighten it I'll have to get a pair of work gloves...So Mazda6 owners, unfortunately you have to go for the SC1034 instead of this one."
"Amazon's sizing guide is wrong: My tire size is 225/65-17. Amazon's size guide says to order SZ135. These chains are too small. Another vendor has an online size guide that says SZ143, which is larger. Since Amazon made me order the wrong size, I cannot guarantee that SZ143 is correct. But SZ135 is incorrect."
would not recommend for Prius: It slips if there is not enough snow on the ground. Need a few inches of snow to grip properly. Would NOT recommend for Prius drivers!
"Liza dodging bullets!!!: When I realized this was an action movie I said to myself ""I have to see this"" Liza Minelli as Della Roberts dodging bullets and taking a stabbing (not to mention shooting a gun) was something else, WAY different from other roles. I wasn't really happy with Burt Reynolds performance as Tony Church but we can't win them all. Overall Minelli's performance was just spectacular, (I was a bit surprised hearing her swear) she is truly an actress."
"Some Songs Are OK: The fans who say this is TM's best album are going way too easy on him. I think they're so devoted to him that they'd buy a CD of him singing the phonebook. About half the songs are OK, the other half are second-rate. I like ""My Old Friend,"" ""Blank Sheet of Paper,"" ""Just Be Your Tear,"" ""Kill Myself,"" and ""Carry On."""
"What have you people done with the Tim I remember?: I have always been a big fan of Mr. McGraw, I must have listened to ""A Place in the Sun"" hundreds of times straight through. But unfortunately, since the ""greatest hits"" album, Tim has fallen off completely and this awful album is the last straw. Earlier reviewers must be listening to another album, no #1's here.In an effort to stick to safe material, a move that never fails to ruin the music, Tim has created another album full of formulaic ""soccer mom"" country with next to zero replay value. The songwriting is laughable, and the Dancehall Doctors should stick to the dancehall. I tacked on an extra star because I still have fond memories of ""All I Want"" and the earlier stuff (even when Tim had a mullet, at least he was still country). If you want real, innovative country, save your money and get you some Dwight Yoakam."
"Really Depressing Album: I am a huge Tim McGraw fan and think he is fabulous in concert. I loved his other albums, but I have to say that this album is just depressing. I have only listened to it once and can't get myself to listen to it again. I wish I had heard the album before I bought it. The title track is the best one on the whole album, besides that there is only one, maybe two others worth listening to. I hope Tim's next album is more upbeat!"
"Tug McGraw's Son STIKES OUT!!: This CD was such a waste of money. I wish I'd heard it before I purchased it. Only the title track was good...what a waste!Tim seems to have lost his Midas Touch. He needs to start writing more of his own music and stop relying on others to pass along his message!BORING, BORING, BORING!Don't bother....this is a real slop collection! C'mon Tim...thrill us with some talent, would ya?!? I might consider a collection of ""The Best Of"" from Tim....but I doubt I'll spend my hard earned cash on anything else from him again."
"Go Back to Country Songs: I heard this album at a friends house, and I did not like it. I think Tim McGraw has a great country voice! But he should think about going back to singing country songs. I liked his first and second album, and those are the albums I own. The other seven albums have to much of a pop sound. When I listen to counrty music that is exactly what I want to hear.So, If the music industry and Tim reads these reveiws then listen up. Go back to country songs!"
"I guess you can't hit home runs all the time.: Tim's new album is....just bad. As a fan who has most of his previous albums I can say that this album is a real strike out compared to the solid albums he usually delivers. Except for the title track, there is nothing memorable on this album. It's full of forgettable songs. There's nothing interesting musically or lyrically happening here. If I were you, I'd pass on this album and buy an earlier album or wait for his next one."
"Save your money, read this review:: If his own principles had been applied to the book it could be reduced to a a few bullet points.*the web is slow, less is more.*tell people what a link leads too before they press it, and make sure it does.*use standard fonts in easy to read colours.*use standard web conventions where ever possible as they are familiar.*check for spelling mistakes and grammar errors.*write concisely and arrange depth of detail in hierarchies, like they do in errr reference books.*tell the user where they are, and how they got their, um like a path prehaps.*some people have small screens, some don't even use microsoft browsers, not everyone has the latest plug ins, allow for it.*don't employ frustrated artists to design your site, use an engineer.Jakob proudly states he has multiple patents in the field of usability, maybe following this book will infringe them, or maybe he just kept the good stuff for himself."
"Not Stainless Steel: These pliers are not stainless steel. They came packed/coated with a yellowish oil, like mild steel tools often are. The description didn't specify the materials so now I know to look for that. The manufacturers box that they were delivered in had the word ""Stainless"" before Steel scratched off with a black magic marker."
"Great smelling stuff!: A wonderful woodsy, spicy scent that will get you compliments. It's not heavy or strong and for the price, you get a great amount. It's a must-have cologne for my collection. I love wearing it."
"Disappointing After 50 pages!: I actually never finished this one. Came recommended to me by a tug boat captain who started it while waiting for a dredge to fill up his hopper barge. I know how boring it can be steaming to and from the dumping grounds, especially at two knots, but a person would have to be lost on a deserted island to find this book even the slightest bit captivating. It starts out interesting enough, with some high stakes backstory about a captain going out on a financial limb to start his own salvage business, but it quickly degenerates into a cheap Hollywood actioner, complete with plastic characters and a forced romance to boot, which happens as soon as the main character reaches the antarctic to rescue a stricken cruise ship. If you ask me, you're better off with Jan De Hartog, Farley Mowatt, Joseph Conrad, Jack London, and for more contemporary sea fare, David Poyer."
"Great Intellectual: Jean Jacques Rousseau is truly a great intellectual.His Discourses and The Social Contract are some of the best in Enlightenment thinking. In the Discourses Rousseau exalts the ""noble"" savage free from the corrupting influence of modern civilization. He believes that civilization has corrupted man from his original, yet ignorant state. I found the Discourses to be a little flighty and unrealistic. The Social Contract was a different story altogether. This is a monumental work. In it Rousseau shows his vast knowledge of the Roman Republic and Empire and the reasons for it's rise and collapse. Rousseau also denounces monarchy and aristocracy as forms of government and exalts republicanism. He also decries the power of organized religion in the oppression of mankind. With his ""General Will"" theory of the social contract he shows true brilliance. A great buy."
"Alexis de Tocqueville's Nemesis: 'The tyranny of the majority' - a brilliant phrase coined by the author of 'Democracy In America' and a brilliant chink in the armour of Rousseau's societal vision. An individual who owes everything to the state cannot conceivably be called an 'individual.' They are, rather, reduced to being an automated cog in the wheel of human motion. Their very individuality is subsumed to serve the will of the collective. This cannot be right. Minorities must be protected. If not, they will find a way. However, I agree, as Orwell did, that there must be a rejection of 'every form of man's dominion over man.' We are equal but different. This paradox resists neat hyperbole."
"Dissatisfied: I was very dissatisfied with this product. I was supposed to receive a 2-Disc set as it specifically states on the cover. I received only one disc, the ""Yoga Core"". The main reason for me ordering was to have the ""Goddess Booty"" disc to firm up my tush!!! I was highly upset :("
"The day when Mystery dyed: The day when Mystery dyed was the day when mystery turned Politically Correct. How sad. Somehow I hoped, that my favourite writer and the British Mystery will be saved, but no..."

Was the situation corrected?: I wanted to buy this item (since the 2.4MHZ item of the same kind did not work at my place due to all the interferences) but the previus review stopped me. I wonder if the previous reviewer's situation was corrected by amazon.com in that they sent the right item. I could not find the direct email of the previous reviewer to ask directly.
"unreliable piece of.....: I bought this a couple years ago, when there was no alternative.I got one transmitter, and 3 receivers.Every week or so, when nothing has changed, I needed to change to another channel to get it to work right.When someone walks in the wrong place, the picture would go wonky, and sound was lost.The transmitter quit after a year or so, and I bought another.This week, that one broke.I've been fighting with this thing for a couple years.So, I just bought the Nyrius, and it works better with the first plug in than this one worked ever.Better picture, better stability.Good bye RF Link, I won't miss you....."
"be careful: Seemed like an easy solution to my problem, but this product does not penetrate walls with it's signal, as advertised. Instructions were a bit lacking. Found the manufacturer's web site, signed in, asked for help.........absolutely NO RESPONSE."
"It actually works pretty well.: These kinds of devices can sometimes be questionable. I was pleasantly surprised that it actually works pretty well. Once the aiming of the antennas is complete, the picture and sound are near original source quality. Considering how much data has to be sent between the sender and receiver wirelessly, it seems pretty amazing."
do not buy...: i tried it and gave up. The picture quality is very bad. cant go thought 3 walls... I used it for 1 time. don't waste your money
"Great if I only need 2 minutes of TV: When hooking this product up to my DISH network 311 receiver it only worked for 2 minutes, wonderfully I might add, then would stop. I did this three times and thought I would write to the company for support, due to the instruction manual lacking information. Well I now see that the instruction manual originated from this same company, because I still have yet to hear a response email back from them and its been over two weeks!! In concept this is a great product, but still needs tons of work and support along with it."
"Disappointing: Considering all of the positive reviews, maybe I just got a lemon. I have a similar 2.4GHz version that I bought years ago at Radio Shack. It has great reception, but it is also very susceptible to interference. I bought this thinking it would be an upgrade since it touted greater range and little or no interference. It may not be getting any interference, but the signal/reception is terrible. Nowhere near as good as the older 2.4GHz unit, sitting in the exact same place with the same antenna orientation. Sending it back."
"Couldn't be better: I ordered this not really expecting to work as well as it does.The receiver is one floor above the transmitter, maybe 20 feet away, and the signal must pass through a 'light' concrete slab containing radiant heating tubes. The picture and sound couldn't be better, even on an old, cheap 13"" TV. Although some reviewers have complained about the remote control transmitter, ours works perfectly. (I placed it, dome-side up, about an inch from the satellite box's remote window.) I'm ordering a second receiver to use with another TV, and I'll review that setup once it's working."
"just the right fit: The replacement pneumatic wheel is just the right size, sturdy, does the job well. It's easy to install. Highly recommended."
"Works Great: The Ridgid dado insert works very well .Went into place in about 5 min ,adjusted the height of the insert to match table and I was off to work ."
Classic!: Every child should know Good Night Moon by heart and what could be better than to hold the bunny while it is being read to you.
"Too large: The contents was as expected. The size is much too large. If you mentioned the size, I missed it. Not suitable as a gift at this time."
"An every night ritual for 2 1/2 years!: My daughter has always loved to be read to. She preferred this book from day one! As we have read it so many times, she now has it memorized to the point that she reads it to me. It is as sweet and soothing a book as I have had the pleasure to read."
"brilliant bedtime book for two year old: I cant believe what an instant hit this book has been. Our two year old has a collection of 20 or so books, all of which he plays with but is never that interested in being read the stories. We needed a book to become part of a night time routine and this book became an instant favourite. We have to negotiate maximum number of times we read it before starting!He loves finding the pictures mentioned in the poem, also joining in when he hears the word ""hush"" and I love how the pictures get darker and darker until you see a room at night time, really sets the atmosphere for going to sleep.Highly recommended."
"Why all the great reviews?: I bought this for my baby thinking it was a great book since it received so many raving reviews. I was so disappointed when I received it. The artwork is horrible, the story is boring. This is my sons least favorite book. Don't waste your money on this!"
bed time read: This is a good book for a bedtime read. A book a child will want to hear over and over. They will one day read it to you.
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this book!: My 21 month old son has me read this book to him EVERY night. He loves it! He points out the clock, the light, the balloon, the moon, and the rabbit who is going to sleep. His favorite page is the last page when the room is dark and the little old lady has gone. I just can't say enough good things about this book."
"Weak Character Development and Plot: Goodnight Moon? Ha! What a joke. Margaret Wise doesn't seem too wise to me, writing foolish books about bears in chairs and bowls of mush. What is mush? What is that? It looks utterly disgusting, like something they would feed you at a nursing home.I also don't want my child (who is a beautiful baby boy) saying goodnight to his food. That's just plain weird. Even though I never intend to feed him the ""mush"" the mother forces down her child's throat in this gut-wrenching novel, I don't want kids to make fun of him on the playground when he waves goodbye to his PB&J; as he throws it out.If you want messed up kids, read them this book. It'll mess with their heads. Goodnight bowl of mush? Are you serious? What is mush? Don't even get me started."
A must have!: Every child on earth should own a copy of this book. It has been a favorite for all three of my sons. It's a classic that is probably the best known among the first books for children. It's a perfect gift for anyone you know having a baby.
"Going on copy number 2: We love this book. My son adores it. After bath time, we put him in his crib and give him a book to play with while we read him another one. Goodnight Moon is one of the very few books that he has no desire to play with or read another book while we are reading this one (Guess How Much I Love You is another).We love this story because it is so interactive. Now that he is getting older, he points out all the things in the story, he counts to three (three little bears sitting in chairs) and he says Night Night after each Good Night page. We just love it.As I said we are going on book number 2 here. The first book is too well loved and we need another copy of it.Truly a timeless classic."
"Goodnight Moon w/Bunny: If you are familiar with the book, you know the story. This book has kind of become a family tradition. It was time to pass it on to a great-nephew...and the bunny was a bonus. (bunny is child-safe...no buttons). If you're looking for a sweet story to read at bedtime (over and over again) so it is eventually asked for, this is a great selection.Shipping was prompt and the product in brand new condition."
"Great book going to a 2nd Generation parent for their little one!: Great book going to a 2nd Generation parent for their little one! This book was a favorite when our sons were little, now that one of them are parents, it was a gift to them when their first child was born. It brougth tears to his eyes and read it to his new born son in the hospital, while his wife had the video camera. What a great tradition!!!"
"A Book For All Time: Can't wait til my grandson is a little older so I can read this book to him. Actually I read it to him now but I think he'll get more out of it as time goes by. It's the perfect book in its' simplicity. The words flow in a natural bed-time kind of rhythm and it conjurs up those kinds of images that make you remember what being a child was all about.The pictures in the book are very nice too, very wise use of colour but the story holds up even if there were no pictures.I read this to my kids when they were very young but they still remember it like it was yesterday...and so do I....that's what makes it a classic."
Great Book!: My husband reads this book to our 4-month-old son every night after he gets home from work. They both love it and I enjoy listening to him read this to our son. I have it memorized and I've hardly ever read it to our son. It's wonderful. I like the way it changes between black and white pages and color.
"It'll put you to sleep alright!: My daughter never liked this book. My husband nor I ever cared for it either. It didn't keep our daughter's attention at all nor did it ""soothe"". It just didn't live up to all the hype. We read to our daughter all the time and have since her birth and she loves almost all books, but not this one. She much prefered Sandra Boynton's board books."
"Almost--but not quite--perfect kidlit.: Margaret Wise Brown, <strong>Goodnight Moon</strong> (Harper, 1947)How does one review a classic? Especially when one is going to say it isn't perfect? Don't get me wrong, I love this book, and I've long lost count of the number of times I've read it over the years, both as a child myself in the sixties and seventies and reading it to my kids in the nineties and now. And maybe my problem with it is as minor as minor comes (the rhythm, impeccable in the rest of the book, hits a snag on the line ""and a young mouse"", which is missing a syllable necessary to keep it in line with everything else). But still... you'd think in a book this short the author would pay that much more attention to each line, wouldn't you? Not that you need me to tell you--I don't think I've ever met anyone who has never encountered <em>Goodnight Moon</em> before--but you'll jar on that line the first time you hit it. Otherwise... perfect. ****"
"Very, very sweet. Nice ears, too!: It's hard to get away with wearing bunny slippers when you're an adult, but on babies they sure are cute! This set is a good gift risk, in case the baby already has 6,000 copies of Goodnight Moon."
Amazed this book got so many good reviews: My daughter and I were not impressed with this book. The grey pages were boring and the figures too small. Saying goodnight to everything in the room can be done quite easily without this book.
"What is this book's appeal?: I feel a little silly to be about the only one who doesn't get this book's appeal. It shows the same pictures over and over again, and every other page is black and white. No appeal whatsoever to my daughter, now age 18 months, who has had this book since birth. People say it's the 'lulling"" repeatability of the goodnight theme... I say, it's boring. There are so many bright, lively, board books out there today. I do not recommend this one, classic or not."
"Does not work With A2 clippers:: I bought this adapter kit to use withOster 078005-314 Turbo A5 2-Speed Clipper.This kit simply does not work - clippers on their own work great, once I put adapter on - they just do not cut at all.I ended up buying two additional length blades instead of this adapter kit and extra blades work great."
"This product doesn't work with the GroomMaster: This product should not be advertized to buy with the Groom Master Clipper by Oster. although it says these comb guides are ""universal"" they aren't! They don't even come close to fitting on the extra wide cutting head of the Groom Master! DO NOT buy them for the GM!"
"DON'T BUY!: DON'T BUY! This product is a total waste of money. I had read the reviews and just thought maybe since I was shaving a little Pomeranian and not a larger dog that maybe I wouldn't be as rough on them. WRONG! The other reviews read right! The clippers would not cut using the attatchments and I tried them all. NONE WORKED! Also, one broke the first time I used it. I couldn't return it because it was past the return time table by the time I got around to using it for the first time. WHAT A JOKE! Learn from my mistake. That's why these reviews are put here."
Mo' better music: Flic has appeared on cable in a cycle lately and I became interested in the music expecially the title track - the musicians are excellent
NOT RATED: I wanted the basis for the movie Stanley & Iris which Union Street is but it isn't the screenplay or anything close. So I have no rating. I'll donate the book to the library.
"Worth the time and money: It is true that this work is not among Shakespeare's greatest by any stretch of the imagination. This entire play reflects the immaturity of a young William Shakespeare. What makes the play so interesting however, are the themes that are explored within the play. He compares the love between a man and a woman with the friendship between two people to see which is more powerful. In addition, Shakespeare uses three fools (or rather two fools and a clown) to enhance the comedic elements of the play. While the plot may not be entirely believeable or even politically correct in today's society, when taken in context, this play is still worth the time and money."
"An introduction to medieval and renaissance literature: For those interested in studying medieval and renaissance literature, this book is all but indispensible for understanding the world view of the writers of that period (and thus understanding the books they wrote.) In some ways, I believe this is the best book Lewis ever wrote. However, I doubt the book would appeal to the general reader, and more interesting material would be available in Lewis's fiction or works of theology."
Pretty Good: This book is good. It does provide the basic and some detailed information you need to make an informed decision regarding a product but one thing I was dissatisfied with was that regarding shea butter she may have been afraid to comment whether good or bad because of the popularity of this particular ingredient. She didn't say whether it was toxic or nontoxic; irritating or nonirritating or maybe she doesn't have enough information about it. I'm more interested in natural ingredients so I want more details concerning it.
"Chili Pepper Encyclopedia: If I had realized there were no colored photos in this book, I wouldn't have bought it. It was supposed to be a gift for a gardener who likes growing chilies, but I decided the format wasn't very interesting.Chilies are among the most beautiful fruits you can grow - but no colored illustrations other than the cover? Sorry, in my opinion, this is a poor presentation."
Great for little kids!: My 2 1/2 year old loves these books. She has about worn them out.Good illustrations and story messages that are all boiled down to something they can understand.
"Good Book.....hopefully, good movie: Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia, Boogie Nights) to direct an adaptation of this book called There Will Be Blood."
"An Interesting Premise ...: ... but the way the story unfolds after the divergence from the historical decision is a little too obvious. Anyone with a knowledge of the historic three-day battle at Gettysburg will immediately notice the parallels with Pickett's Charge. While overall an entertaining novel, the historic ""irony"" was a little too much for this Son of Pennsylvania ... Read Coddington's ""A Study in Command"" on Gettysburg ... history makes for a better read."
"Untrue Tale: This book might be fine just for reading by someone with no clue to history. To use Gettysburg for a title is such a misleading and for anyone(Dennis Showalter) to use Killer Angels as a comparison is such a misleading statement. There is NO Alternative History and NO ""Quite Differently"" as to what happened at Gettysburg.A book of pure fantasy."
"A very realistic book about a different Gettysburg...: Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen get together to write a very realistic Civil War novel about what would have happened if Robert E. Lee decided to carry out a sweeping, massive movement to out-flank the Union Army. Unlike most books about the Civil War, this book tosses out luck and almost magical changes in the thoughts of the main characters, basing the action and combat on the reality of the men and the leaders within both armies.The battle scenes are painfully real, causing me to feel horror at some of details. Both authors refuse to hide anything, showing the heroism and the gore that was the Civil War battlefield.A must for a What-If library or a Civil War library!"
"too technical: I found this to be too full of military jargon, with not enough maps to make sense of the battles."
"Gettysburg/Grant Comes East/Never Call Retreat: Well into the third book in the series. Makes me feel like I was there, (sure glad I wasn't). Great reading, can't seem to put the series down. Sure makes you think on what might have happened. Personality traits of the main characters true to form and parallel nicely with what I have read. I really enjoyed this Trilogy and would strongly recommend it as a ""must read"" by any Civil War Buff as an easy and enjoyable adjunct to what has been written."
"Where was the editor?: Apparently the authors believe that if General Lee had been of a single minded purpose heading into the Battle of Gettysburg, the outcome might have been different. And they tell us what that single minded purpose should have been--over and over and over and over.Then there is the 5 page sequence where three different characters almost ""gag"" from something they see or smell. SOMEBODY MUST HAVE BEEN NAUSEOUS WHEN THEY WERE WRITNG THAT CHAPTER.I have read many books about the Civil War. They were all more worthy of my time than this one, with the possible exception of The Longest Night."
"Not an Historical Novel: This book was written very well, but it offended. The south did not win the war, and rightly so. If you want to read about the battle of Gettysburg, read Killer Angels -- it is the real story, which cannot be improved upon. What will be next, Newt writing a book about Hitler winning WWII? This book is an insult to the thousands of men who gave their lives to keep our county in one piece."
"About Time,...: It's amazing to me how long it took for a tool like this to hit the market, but it's finally here. This is an invaluable tool for recent grads and/or those ""re-entering"" the job market after years in a career and away from interviewing. As a former manager/hirer, I know how quickly an opportunity can end for a candidate who isn't prepared, doesn't understand the process, or isn't up to speed on the appropriate questions/answers. This video covers those topics and others, from the perspective of professionals. It's a powerful interview preparatory tool."
"Designer Self Help: Great little pick-me-up book. Bright, easy, fun.Nice to catch this glimpse into a world renowned designer's headand find such practical, pleasant, salt-of-the-earth thinking going on."
"1 Hour was not Enough: So many plotholes I dare not go into them here. This being 1 hour in length there were so many scenes that raised questions which were never answered. While Corbin Bernson stole the scenes by nailing down his seedy lawyer character in the first half hour, the film then falls apart as it abruptly tries to become horrific but so many unecesary scenes are added from out of nowhere with no resolution. It seems as though this was meant to have been at least 100 minutes, but scenes were deleted resulting in a film which could have been decent, but instead turns out to be a waste of time."
"not practical: It looks fine, the colors are great, but it is completely useless. It wasstripped after one or two uses. You cannot put anything heavier than apiece of paper on it or it slides over and everything is on the floor.If you want some decoration by your piano buy this, if you want amusic stand look elsewhere."
"Too much product, not enough info.: I purchaced this drive for two reasons. I needed an external writing drive for my laptop, and I wanted to transfer VHS tapes to DVD. As an external drive, it seems to be a solid, well-built(although slightly costly) drive. I was very disappointed at it's ability to transfer VHS to DVD though. After installing the software and reading the manual, I found out that I needed to buy an additional video capture card. The really big problem there is that most cards on the market transfer analog video on your internal drive, making the external writer completely unnecessary. My advice would be to only buy this as a primary writing drive, of which there are equally good and less expensive models out there. If I had to do it over, that would have been my course."
"*NOT* Mac Compatible: In spite of a product description that says the contrary, this product is NOT MAC COMPATIBLE. It will *NOT* burn DVD's under OS-X. This straight from the mouth of Iomega tech support."
"WATCH OUT!!! BEWARE!!!: This device was a major bust!!! Will NOT properly transfer any format data,music,video from a Win98SE to blanks then to WinXP MC2004 computer. Crashes computer and the included CD/DVD software willNOT work properly. Sonic CinePlayer froze computer up and would not load. Installation software changed config.sys/ regedit/autoecec files to its own parameter and rendered my internal cr-rom drive inoperable. After 7 hours on non-toll free repair line with Iomega got that working but Sonic tech support could NOT fix freeze problem so I had to return it for full refund. Iomega is a piece of junk and its 3rd party software sucks!! Sabve your money go Sony or LaCie d2!!"
"Wonderful Documentary: This is a very insightfull documentary that details all the parties involved in the trade of The Great One to the L.A. Kings. I highly recommend this to anyone, even if you are not a hockey fan."
